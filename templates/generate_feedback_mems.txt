You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
{QUESTION}

Predicted SQL:
{SQL}

Execution Result:
{EXECUTE_RESULT}

Evaluation Result:
{EVALUATE_RESULT}

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Questionâ€™s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.
