You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
{DATABASE_SCHEMA}

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
{LONG_TERM_MEMS}

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
{SHORT_TERM_MEMS}

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
4. Focus on accuracy, alignment, and completeness of the SQL query based on the Question.
5. Avoid unnecessary columns or redundant information; only output what is specifically required by the Question.

Question: 
{QUESTION} 

Hint:
{HINT}

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your detailed thought process explaining the steps taken to arrive at the SQL query.",
    "SQL": "The final SQL query in a single string."
}}

Take a deep breath, review all inputs systematically, and generate the most optimal SQLite query.
