Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: Under the vote type of 8, provide the display names and websites URLs of the user who got the highest bounty amount.
Hint: vote type of 8 refers to VoteTypeId = 8; the highest bounty amount refers to MAX(BountyAmount);

Please provide your findings as a Python list, capturing the essence of both the question and hint through the identified terms and phrases.

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Under the vote type of 8, provide the display names and websites URLs of the user who got the highest bounty amount. 

Hint:

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query to ensure it retrieves the correct results as intended, you need to adjust the WHERE clause to correctly filter for the user associated with the maximum bounty amount. The original subquery is currently only returning the highest bounty amount but does not specify the user corresponding to that amount. Here\u2019s how you can refine the query:\n\n1. Instead of using a subquery directly in the WHERE clause to match `V.BountyAmount`, consider using a CTE (Common Table Expression) or an inline view to first get the maximum bounty amount along with the corresponding user.\n\n2. Use the following structure for the SQL statement:\n\n```sql\nWITH MaxBounty AS (\n    SELECT UserId, MAX(BountyAmount) AS MaxAmount\n    FROM votes\n    WHERE VoteTypeId = 8\n    GROUP BY UserId\n) \nSELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl\nFROM votes V \nJOIN users U ON V.UserId = U.Id \nJOIN MaxBounty MB ON V.UserId = MB.UserId AND V.BountyAmount = MB.MaxAmount \nWHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8;\n``` \n\n3. This query first calculates the maximum bounty amount per user (under the specified vote type) and then retrieves the DisplayName and WebsiteUrl of the corresponding users who have that maximum bounty. This ensures you gather the correct user details based on their highest bounty amount."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to ensure it retrieves the correct results as intended, you need to adjust the WHERE clause to correctly filter for the user associated with the maximum bounty amount. The original subquery is currently only returning the highest bounty amount but does not specify the user corresponding to that amount. Here’s how you can refine the query:

1. Instead of using a subquery directly in the WHERE clause to match `V.BountyAmount`, consider using a CTE (Common Table Expression) or an inline view to first get the maximum bounty amount along with the corresponding user.

2. Use the following structure for the SQL statement:

```sql
WITH MaxBounty AS (
    SELECT UserId, MAX(BountyAmount) AS MaxAmount
    FROM votes
    WHERE VoteTypeId = 8
    GROUP BY UserId
) 
SELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl
FROM votes V 
JOIN users U ON V.UserId = U.Id 
JOIN MaxBounty MB ON V.UserId = MB.UserId AND V.BountyAmount = MB.MaxAmount 
WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8;
``` 

3. This query first calculates the maximum bounty amount per user (under the specified vote type) and then retrieves the DisplayName and WebsiteUrl of the corresponding users who have that maximum bounty. This ensures you gather the correct user details based on their highest bounty amount.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl FROM votes V JOIN users U ON V.UserId = U.Id WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8 AND V.BountyAmount = (SELECT MAX(BountyAmount) FROM votes WHERE VoteTypeId = 8);']

Question: 
Under the vote type of 8, provide the display names and websites URLs of the user who got the highest bounty amount. 

Hint:
vote type of 8 refers to VoteTypeId = 8; the highest bounty amount refers to MAX(BountyAmount);

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "First, I analyzed the question which requires the display names and website URLs of users who received the highest bounty amount, specifically under vote type 8 (VoteTypeId = 8). To achieve this, I need to determine the maximum bounty amount for each user under this vote type. My initial thought was to use a subquery to get the maximum bounty amount, but I remember that a more structured approach is to use a CTE (Common Table Expression) for better readability and maintainability. The CTE will aggregate the data to extract the maximum bounty amounts and associate them with the corresponding user ID. Then, I can join this CTE with the users' table to retrieve their display names and website URLs. This structure satisfies the requirement of efficiently identifying users linked to the maximum bounty and ensures the correct selection of columns based on the needs outlined in the question.",
    "SQL": "WITH MaxBounty AS ( SELECT UserId, MAX(BountyAmount) AS MaxAmount FROM votes WHERE VoteTypeId = 8 GROUP BY UserId ) SELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl FROM votes V JOIN users U ON V.UserId = U.Id JOIN MaxBounty MB ON V.UserId = MB.UserId AND V.BountyAmount = MB.MaxAmount WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8;"
