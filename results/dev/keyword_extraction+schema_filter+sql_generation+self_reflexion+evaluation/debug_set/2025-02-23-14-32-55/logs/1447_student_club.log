Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The current SQL query appears to filter events that have a remaining budget greater than 0, but does not correctly identify events that have underspent their budget (meaning their actual expenditure was less than the budgeted amount). Modify the query to include the actual expenditure in the budget comparison. Here’s how to adjust the query: 

1. Ensure the budget table has an 'actual_spent' column that indicates how much was actually spent for each event. 
2. Change the WHERE clause to compare the remaining budget with the actual expenditure. The updated condition should check for events where the actual expenditure is less than the budget allocated. 

The modified SQL could look like this: 

```sql
SELECT T1.event_name, T1.location 
FROM event AS T1 
INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event 
WHERE T2.budget_amount > T2.actual_spent
```

This change ensures that only events that underspent their budget are selected.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0']

Question: 
List the name and location of events that underspend its budget. 

Hint:
name of event refers to event_name; underspend its budget refers to remaining > 0

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To address the question of listing the name and location of events that underspend their budgets, I need to identify two main components from the database schema: the event details and the budget details. The relevant columns for the output are 'event_name' and 'location' from the 'event' table. The condition that defines 'underspending' requires examining the budget, specifically looking at the relationship between the 'remaining' budget and the actual expenditure, which was referred to as 'actual_spent' in the long-term memory guidelines. However, the budget table does not initially indicate an 'actual_spent' column, so we need to assume that 'spent' reflects the actual expenditure for this purpose. Therefore, I should check the condition where 'spent' is less than 'amount' (as an alternative expression for remaining budget). The logical next step is to join the 'event' table with the 'budget' table on their respective keys. Completing this thought process leads to the following SQL query, ensuring alignment with the provided guidelines and avoiding SQL pitfalls.",

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To address the issue and ensure the SQL query aligns with the question's intent of listing events that underspend their budget, please take the following steps: 

1. **Remove Duplicate Entries**: The query currently returns duplicate event entries (e.g., 'February Speaker' appears multiple times). Use the DISTINCT clause to ensure unique results.
   - Update the SELECT statement to: `SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name, T1.location ...`

2. **Check for Correct Synchronization**: Ensure that the 'spent' and 'amount' columns in the budget table are correctly indicating the amounts; confirm that you're using the correct column names and calculations.
   - Confirm that T2.spent and T2.amount exist in the budget table and are of numeric type.

3. **Handle Null Locations**: The query results include events with `None` as their location. Consider filtering out such entries if the intent is to only list events with valid locations.
   - Add a condition in the WHERE clause: `AND T1.location IS NOT NULL`

4. **Verify Join Logic**: Ensure that the JOIN condition accurately connects events to their respective budgets. The link_to_event should correctly refer to event_id, confirming that records match.

5. **Additional Debugging**: If necessary, run subqueries to confirm the values in the budget table to ensure they reflect expected financial performance. 
   - For example, a simple query to fetch all spent and amount records could help identify any discrepancies.

After applying these modifications, the revised SQL query should properly reflect the question’s intent and return results without duplicates or irrelevant entries.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0', 'SELECT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.spent < T2.amount']

Question: 
List the name and location of events that underspend its budget. 

Hint:
name of event refers to event_name; underspend its budget refers to remaining > 0

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To address the question of listing the name and location of events that underspend their budget, we first identify the relevant tables: 'event' and 'budget'. The 'event_name' is found in the 'event' table and the 'location' is also contained there. The 'budget' table provides the information on budget spent and remaining amounts. The key condition to match events that underspend their budget is to check if the amount spent (T2.spent) is less than the allocated amount (T2.amount). Therefore, we need to join these two tables on the foreign key 'link_to_event' from the 'budget' table to the 'event_id' of the 'event' table. To ensure that we get unique results, I will utilize the DISTINCT clause. I will also ensure that there are no null values in the location field by adding a filter. After considering these aspects, the SQL query is constructed to accurately reflect the requirements.",

Input Data
###
Question:
List the name and location of events that underspend its budget.

Incorrect SQL:
SELECT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0
SELECT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.spent < T2.amount

Correct SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.spent < T2.amount AND T1.location IS NOT NULL
