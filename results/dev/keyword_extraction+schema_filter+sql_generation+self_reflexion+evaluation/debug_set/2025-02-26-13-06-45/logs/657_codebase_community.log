Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: Under the vote type of 8, provide the display names and websites URLs of the user who got the highest bounty amount.
Hint: vote type of 8 refers to VoteTypeId = 8; the highest bounty amount refers to MAX(BountyAmount);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Under the vote type of 8, provide the display names and websites URLs of the user who got the highest bounty amount. 

Hint:
vote type of 8 refers to VoteTypeId = 8; the highest bounty amount refers to MAX(BountyAmount);

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{

{
    "feedback": "To address the issue with the SQL query and ensure it meets the requirement of providing the display names and website URLs of users with the highest bounty amount under VoteTypeId = 8, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Correct Maximum Bounty Amount**: Ensure you are correctly determining the maximum bounty amount for the specified vote type (VoteTypeId = 8). This requires explicitly filtering for this vote type.\n\n2. **Modify the Inner Query**: Change the inner query to use a more accurate structure that not only matches the maximum bounty amount but also returns the associated user details (DisplayName and WebsiteUrl). The current approach may lead to inconsistent results due to the subquery's possible failure to link correctly with the outer query.\n\n3. **Utilize a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a JOIN**: Instead of a subquery that returns a single scalar value, consider using a CTE to first select the maximum bounty amount and then join this result back to the votes and users table to correctly filter the users.\n\nHere\u2019s a refined version of your SQL query:\n```sql\nWITH MaxBounty AS (\n    SELECT MAX(BountyAmount) AS MaxBountyAmount\n    FROM votes\n    WHERE VoteTypeId = 8\n)\nSELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl\nFROM votes AS V\nJOIN users AS U ON V.UserId = U.Id\nJOIN MaxBounty MB ON V.BountyAmount = MB.MaxBountyAmount\nWHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8;\n``` \n4. **Test the Query**: After modifying the query, run it to ensure it provides the expected results. If it still returns None values, check to ensure that there is indeed data that matches VoteTypeId = 8 with corresponding valid BountyAmounts in your votes table.\n\n5. **Check Data Existence**: Finally, validate that the relevant data exists for the specified conditions. Lack of data could also lead to None results."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To address the issue with the SQL query and ensure it meets the requirement of providing the display names and website URLs of users with the highest bounty amount under VoteTypeId = 8, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Correct Maximum Bounty Amount**: Ensure you are correctly determining the maximum bounty amount for the specified vote type (VoteTypeId = 8). This requires explicitly filtering for this vote type.

2. **Modify the Inner Query**: Change the inner query to use a more accurate structure that not only matches the maximum bounty amount but also returns the associated user details (DisplayName and WebsiteUrl). The current approach may lead to inconsistent results due to the subquery's possible failure to link correctly with the outer query.

3. **Utilize a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a JOIN**: Instead of a subquery that returns a single scalar value, consider using a CTE to first select the maximum bounty amount and then join this result back to the votes and users table to correctly filter the users.

Here’s a refined version of your SQL query:
```sql
WITH MaxBounty AS (
    SELECT MAX(BountyAmount) AS MaxBountyAmount
    FROM votes
    WHERE VoteTypeId = 8
)
SELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl
FROM votes AS V
JOIN users AS U ON V.UserId = U.Id
JOIN MaxBounty MB ON V.BountyAmount = MB.MaxBountyAmount
WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8;
``` 
4. **Test the Query**: After modifying the query, run it to ensure it provides the expected results. If it still returns None values, check to ensure that there is indeed data that matches VoteTypeId = 8 with corresponding valid BountyAmounts in your votes table.

5. **Check Data Existence**: Finally, validate that the relevant data exists for the specified conditions. Lack of data could also lead to None results.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl FROM votes AS V JOIN users AS U ON V.UserId = U.Id WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8 AND V.BountyAmount = (SELECT MAX(BountyAmount) FROM votes WHERE VoteTypeId = 8)']

Question: 
Under the vote type of 8, provide the display names and websites URLs of the user who got the highest bounty amount. 

Hint:
vote type of 8 refers to VoteTypeId = 8; the highest bounty amount refers to MAX(BountyAmount);

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

############################## Human at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

You are a specialist in SQL analysis, performing tasks involved in generating SQL improvement feedback. The contextual clues provided below are:

1.The erroneous SQL statement,
2.The corresponding natural language question and guidance for addressing the issue,
3.The database schema item representations,
4.The underlying cause of the SQL error.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback instructions to guide a large language model on how to refine the SQL query, ensuring it accurately aligns with the core requirements of the problem.

Input Data
###
Erroneous SQL:
WITH MaxBounty AS (SELECT MAX(BountyAmount) AS MaxBountyAmount FROM votes WHERE VoteTypeId = 8) SELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl FROM votes AS V JOIN users AS U ON V.UserId = U.Id WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8 AND V.BountyAmount = (SELECT MaxBountyAmount FROM MaxBounty);

Question:
Under the vote type of 8, provide the display names and websites URLs of the user who got the highest bounty amount.

Guidance:
vote type of 8 refers to VoteTypeId = 8; the highest bounty amount refers to MAX(BountyAmount);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure the SQL query fulfills the request of providing the display names and website URLs of the user who received the highest bounty amount under VoteTypeId = 8, follow these steps: 1. Modify the CTE (Common Table Expression) to include the UserId associated with the maximum BountyAmount. Update the CTE from: 'WITH MaxBounty AS (SELECT MAX(BountyAmount) AS MaxBountyAmount FROM votes WHERE VoteTypeId = 8)' to 'WITH MaxBounty AS (SELECT UserId, MAX(BountyAmount) AS MaxBountyAmount FROM votes WHERE VoteTypeId = 8 GROUP BY UserId)'. 2. Update the main SELECT statement to join this CTE back with the users table on both UserId and the maximum BountyAmount: change 'WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8 AND V.BountyAmount = (SELECT MaxBountyAmount FROM MaxBounty)' to 'WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8 AND V.UserId = (SELECT UserId FROM MaxBounty WHERE MaxBountyAmount = V.BountyAmount)'. This ensures you're correctly selecting the user(s) linked with the highest bounty amounts.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl FROM votes AS V JOIN users AS U ON V.UserId = U.Id WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8 AND V.BountyAmount = (SELECT MAX(BountyAmount) FROM votes WHERE VoteTypeId = 8)', 'WITH MaxBounty AS (SELECT MAX(BountyAmount) AS MaxBountyAmount FROM votes WHERE VoteTypeId = 8) SELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl FROM votes AS V JOIN users AS U ON V.UserId = U.Id JOIN MaxBounty MB ON V.BountyAmount = MB.MaxBountyAmount WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8;', 'WITH MaxBounty AS (SELECT MAX(BountyAmount) AS MaxBountyAmount FROM votes WHERE VoteTypeId = 8) SELECT U.DisplayName, U.WebsiteUrl FROM votes AS V JOIN users AS U ON V.UserId = U.Id WHERE V.VoteTypeId = 8 AND V.BountyAmount = (SELECT MaxBountyAmount FROM MaxBounty);']

Question: 
Under the vote type of 8, provide the display names and websites URLs of the user who got the highest bounty amount. 

Hint:
vote type of 8 refers to VoteTypeId = 8; the highest bounty amount refers to MAX(BountyAmount);

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "First, I need to determine the user who received the highest bounty amount under VoteTypeId = 8. To do this, I will use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first find the maximum bounty amount, along with the corresponding UserId associated with this bounty. I will modify the CTE to select both UserId and the maximum BountyAmount by grouping by UserId. Next, I'll join this CTE with the users table to gather the DisplayName and WebsiteUrl for the user(s) linked to the highest bounty.
