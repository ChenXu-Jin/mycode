Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: List the name and location of events that underspend its budget.
Hint: name of event refers to event_name; underspend its budget refers to remaining > 0

Please provide your findings as a Python list, capturing the essence of both the question and hint through the identified terms and phrases. 
Only output the Python list, no explanations needed.

You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE event (
  event_id   TEXT
        constraint event_pk
            primary key,
  event_name TEXT,
  event_date TEXT,

  notes      TEXT,
  location   TEXT,
  status     TEXT
);

  type        TEXT,
  city        TEXT,
  county      TEXT,
  state       TEXT,
  short_state TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE attendance (
  link_to_event  TEXT,
  link_to_member TEXT,
  primary key (link_to_event, link_to_member),
  foreign key (link_to_event) references event(event_id),
  foreign key (link_to_member) references member(member_id)
);

CREATE TABLE budget (
  budget_id     TEXT
            primary key,
  category      TEXT,
  spent         REAL,
  remaining     REAL,
  amount        INTEGER,
  event_status  TEXT,

  foreign key (link_to_budget) references budget(budget_id),
  foreign key (link_to_member) references member(member_id)
);

CREATE TABLE income (
  income_id      TEXT
        constraint income_pk
            primary key,
  date_received  TEXT,
  amount         INTEGER,
  source         TEXT,
  notes          TEXT,
  link_to_member TEXT,
  foreign key (link_to_member) references member(member_id)
);

CREATE TABLE member (

        constraint member_pk
            primary key,
  first_name    TEXT,
  last_name     TEXT,

);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
List the name and location of events that underspend its budget. 

Hint:
name of event refers to event_name; underspend its budget refers to remaining > 0

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final SQL query.",
    "SQL": "Your SQL query in a single string."
}

Priority should be given to columns that have been explicitly matched with examples relevant to the question's context.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of listing events that underspend their budget, modify the query to check for actual expenditure being less than budgeted amounts. Specifically, you should include a condition that compares the budgeted amount with the actual amount spent on each event. This can be done by adding a WHERE clause that checks if T2.budget > T2.spent (or a similar field representing actual spending). Additionally, ensure to handle potential duplicates, using DISTINCT to avoid repeating event names and locations. The modified SQL query should look like this: SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event T1 JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.budget > T2.spent.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event T1 JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0']

Question: 
List the name and location of events that underspend its budget. 

Hint:
name of event refers to event_name; underspend its budget refers to remaining > 0

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

############################## AI at step actor_generate_sql ##############################

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To generate the SQL query for listing the name and location of events that underspend their budget, I first analyze the requirements of the question. The criteria for underspending is defined as the remaining budget being greater than zero (remaining > 0). The focus is on retrieving the event name and location. Therefore, the relevant columns are event_name from the event table and location from the same table. \n\nNext, I need to join the 'event' table with the 'budget' table to access budget-related data linked to each event. The join can be made on the columns connecting these tables: event_id from the event table (aliased as T1) and link_to_event from the budget table (aliased as T2). \n\nFollowing the join, I will apply a WHERE clause that filters the results to include only those entries where the remaining budget is greater than zero (T2.remaining > 0). This ensures that I only get events that are underspending. \n\nSince the query does not specify that I need to include duplicates, I will also include a DISTINCT clause to eliminate any repeated values for event names and locations.\n\nBy synthesizing these observations, I can arrive at the following SQL query: SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event T1 JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0.",

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

            primary key,
  category      TEXT,

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The query needs to ensure we are capturing events that have underspent their budget. The current condition 'T2.remaining > 0' implies that there is still budget left, which does not directly identify underspending. Instead, we should check for budget spent that exceeds the allocated budget or identify budget entries where the remaining amount is less than the allocated budget. Additionally, ensure that the appropriate aliases are used consistently.

Here are the actionable modifications:
1. Update the condition: Instead of 'T2.remaining > 0', it should be changed to 'T2.remaining < T2.budget' assuming 'budget' is the field that holds the allocated budget amount. This will correctly identify the events that underspend their budget.

2. Ensure there are no NULL values affecting your results: If an event has no budget linked to it, consider excluding it from your results by adding an appropriate condition to check for non-NULL values in your budget fields.

The modified SQL query could look something like:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name, T1.location
FROM event T1
JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event
WHERE T2.remaining < T2.budget AND T2.remaining IS NOT NULL AND T2.budget IS NOT NULL;
```

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event T1 JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0', 'SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event T1 JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0']

Question: 
List the name and location of events that underspend its budget. 

Hint:
name of event refers to event_name; underspend its budget refers to remaining > 0

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To address the question, I first identify the relevant tables: 'event' and 'budget'. The goal is to find events that underspend their budget, which means we are looking for records where the budget 'remaining' amount is less than the allocated total 'amount'. After reviewing the schema, I note that the 'budget' table has 'remaining' and 'amount' fields, which can help flag underspending. I also considered filtering for non-null values in these fields to ensure that I'm not including events without a budget. According to the guiding principles, I will employ the pattern of using JOINs properly and focus on the columns specifically needed: 'event_name' and 'location'. Based on this logic, the SQL query will involve a JOIN between 'event' and 'budget', applying the correct condition to identify underspending events.",
