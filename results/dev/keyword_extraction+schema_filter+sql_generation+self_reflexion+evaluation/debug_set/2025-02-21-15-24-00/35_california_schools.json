First, I will filter schools from the frpm table for those that are chartered. Then, I will sort these schools by their enrollment in grades 1 through 12 in ascending order. Finally, I will limit the results to only the top entry to get the school with the fewest students and retrieve the administrator's email from the schools table. To do this, I will need to join the frpm table and the schools table on the CDSCode, which is the primary key in the schools table and a foreign key in the frpm table.",
