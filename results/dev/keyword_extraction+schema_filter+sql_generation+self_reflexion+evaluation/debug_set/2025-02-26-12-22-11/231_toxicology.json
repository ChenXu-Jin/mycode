Then we will find the bond type that has the maximum count of bonds. Additionally, we need to check if the molecule is carcinogenic by looking into the molecule table for the label of TR018, which will indicate whether it is carcinogenic or not. I will join the bond and molecule tables on molecule_id to access both bond type and the label of the molecule. The final selection will include the bond type and the carcinogenic status as denoted by the label.
