I will have to join the account table with the district table to filter accounts that belong to the district 'Litomerice'. Specifically, I will perform the following steps: 1) Join the `account` table (T1) with the `district` table (T2) on the `district_id` field. 2) Filter the results to only include accounts opened in the year 1996 by checking the `date` column. 3) Count the number of accounts that meet these criteria. 4) I will utilize the `COUNT` function and apply the correct conditions accordingly while ensuring I correctly extract district information from column A2.",
