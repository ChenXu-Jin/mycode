The relevant column for Math scores in the 'satscores' table is 'AvgScrMath'. Next, we need to determine which of these schools are charter-funded. From the 'schools' table, we can identify charter-funded schools using the 'FundingType' column. Therefore, we will need to join the 'satscores' and 'schools' tables on the 'cds' and 'CDSCode' columns respectively. After filtering the schools based on the average Math score and 'FundingType', we will count the number of schools that meet the criteria. The count will be returned as the main result of the query. The use of SQL COUNT function will help us achieve this outcome, and we need to group the results to get a single aggregated count value.",
