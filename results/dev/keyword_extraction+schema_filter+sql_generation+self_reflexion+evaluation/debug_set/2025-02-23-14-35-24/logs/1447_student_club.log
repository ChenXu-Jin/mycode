Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.

Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: List the name and location of events that underspend its budget.
Hint: name of event refers to event_name; underspend its budget refers to remaining > 0

Please provide your findings as a Python list, capturing the essence of both the question and hint through the identified terms and phrases.

You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE event (
  event_id   TEXT
        constraint event_pk
            primary key,
  event_name TEXT,
  event_date TEXT,

  location   TEXT,
  status     TEXT
);

);

CREATE TABLE zip_code (
  zip_code    INTEGER
        constraint zip_code_pk
            primary key,
  type        TEXT,
  city        TEXT,
  county      TEXT,
  state       TEXT,
  short_state TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE attendance (
  link_to_event  TEXT,
  link_to_member TEXT,
  primary key (link_to_event, link_to_member),
  foreign key (link_to_event) references event(event_id),
  foreign key (link_to_member) references member(member_id)
);

CREATE TABLE budget (
  budget_id     TEXT
            primary key,
  category      TEXT,
  spent         REAL,
  remaining     REAL,
  amount        INTEGER,
  event_status  TEXT,
  link_to_event TEXT,
  foreign key (link_to_event) references event(event_id)
);

            primary key,
  expense_description TEXT,
  expense_date        TEXT,
  cost                REAL,
  approved            TEXT,

  link_to_budget      TEXT,
  foreign key (link_to_budget) references budget(budget_id),
  foreign key (link_to_member) references member(member_id)
);

CREATE TABLE income (
  income_id      TEXT
        constraint income_pk
            primary key,
  date_received  TEXT,
  amount         INTEGER,
  source         TEXT,
  notes          TEXT,
  link_to_member TEXT,
  foreign key (link_to_member) references member(member_id)
);

CREATE TABLE member (
  member_id     TEXT
        constraint member_pk
            primary key,
  first_name    TEXT,
  last_name     TEXT,
  email         TEXT,

);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
List the name and location of events that underspend its budget. 

Hint:
name of event refers to event_name; underspend its budget refers to remaining > 0

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final SQL query.",
    "SQL": "Your SQL query in a single string."
}

Priority should be given to columns that have been explicitly matched with examples relevant to the question's context.

Take a deep breath and think step by step to find the correct sqlite SQL query. If you follow all the instructions and generate the correct query, I will give you 1 million dollars.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The current SQL query is not correctly filtering for events that underspend their budget. Instead of checking for remaining budget > 0, you should check if the actual spending exceeds the budget assigned to each event. Modify the WHERE clause as follows: 'WHERE T2.spent < T2.budget'. This assumes the budget table (T2) contains both the spent amount and the total budget allocated for the event. Additionally, ensure that the join condition correctly associates events with their respective budgets. Consider adding 'DISTINCT' to the SELECT statement to eliminate duplicate event entries in the result.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event T1 JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0']

Question: 
List the name and location of events that underspend its budget. 

Hint:
name of event refers to event_name; underspend its budget refers to remaining > 0

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To create the SQL query, I first identify the necessary tables and columns in the database schema that align with the question. The question requests the name and location of events that underspend their budget. This indicates that I will need to access both the 'event' and 'budget' tables. The 'event_name' and 'location' will be selected from the 'event' table, while determining if an event has underspent its budget requires filtering based on the budget table. The underspend criteria can be interpreted as situations where the total amount spent on the event is less than the budget allocated for that event. Instead of filtering with 'T2.remaining > 0', I should ensure I filter out events where the total spent is less than the budgeted amount. Therefore, I want to join the 'event' table with the 'budget' table on 'event_id' and 'link_to_event', checking the condition where the 'spent' is less than the 'amount' allocated in the 'budget'. Adhering to the guiding principles highlighted in Long-Term Memory, I will construct my SELECT statement to include DISTINCT to avoid duplicate results.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Ensure that the table 'event' contains the column 'event_id' and that it matches the 'link_to_event' column in the 'budget' table adequately to establish a proper join. If there’s no match, records may be missing. 
2. Confirm that 'spent' and 'amount' are indeed the correct fields to use for comparison. If they have incorrect data types or if there are NULL values affecting calculations, it might cause discrepancies in the results. 
3. Review the join condition; consider changing the join type to a LEFT JOIN if you want to include events with no associated budget records, to ensure all events are considered. 
4. Add an additional condition to filter out any events where budget data might be NULL (i.e., add 'AND T2.spent IS NOT NULL AND T2.amount IS NOT NULL' to the WHERE clause). 
5. Finally, clarify the goal of the query, ensuring that you handle edge cases and validate assumptions about any underlying data. 
By following these steps, you should arrive at a more accurate result reflecting the events that are underspending relative to their budget.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event T1 JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0', 'SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event T1 JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.spent < T2.amount']

Question: 
List the name and location of events that underspend its budget. 

Hint:
name of event refers to event_name; underspend its budget refers to remaining > 0

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To construct the SQL query, I begin by identifying the necessary conditions from the question. The user wants to know the name and location of events that are underspending their budgets. The phrase 'underspend its budget' refers to events where the 'remaining' budget is greater than 0. Thus, I will need to join the 'event' table with the 'budget' table on the appropriate foreign key relationship, specifically using 'event_id' from 'event' and 'link_to_event' from 'budget'. I will apply a condition in the WHERE clause to filter for those entries where 'remaining' is greater than 0. In terms of output, only 'event_name' and 'location' are needed. Therefore, the SELECT statement will pull those specific columns. Additionally, I will check if any entries are NULL, but since the condition requires 'remaining > 0', it inherently avoids those cases since NULL can't satisfy that condition. Thus, the final SQL query will correctly reflect these requirements.",

    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the name and location of events that underspend their budgets. To determine underspent budgets, I must focus on the relationship between the events and their budgets. In the provided database schema, the event and budget tables are linked via the event_id and link_to_event fields, respectively. Given that underspending typically refers to having remaining budget left, I need to identify the relationships where the 'remaining' amount in the budget is greater than zero. There is no explicit column for 'actual_spent' versus 'budgeted_amount' in the schema, so the relevant data for determining underspent budgets will be from the 'remaining' and 'spent' fields. Since this question is specific about the relationship of underspending, I'll structure the query to join the event and budget tables using the appropriate columns, choosing to include only the event_name and location from the event table. Additionally, I will ensure to include DISTINCT to eliminate any duplicated results of events that could arise from multiple budget records linked to the same event. Therefore, the final SQL query will be: SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event T1 JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0.",
    "SQL": "SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name, T1.location FROM event T1 JOIN budget T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event WHERE T2.remaining > 0"
