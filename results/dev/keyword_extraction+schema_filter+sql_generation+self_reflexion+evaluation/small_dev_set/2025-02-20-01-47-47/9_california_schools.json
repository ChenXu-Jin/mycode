The 'AvgScrMath' column in the 'satscores' table indicates the average score, and the 'Charter' column in the 'schools' table specifies whether a school is charter-funded (with 1 indicating a charter school). Therefore, I will join these two tables based on the foreign key relationship using 'cds' from 'satscores' and 'CDSCode' from 'schools'. After joining, I will apply a filter to select schools where 'AvgScrMath' is greater than 560 and where 'Charter' is 1. I will then count the results. The final SQL query will select only the count of charter-funded schools meeting these criteria.",
