Next, I'll count the number of accounts in the account table that match the identified district_id and were created in the year 1996. The date column in the account table will be filtered to include only records from 1996. I will use a JOIN to connect the 'account' table and the 'district' table based on district_id. Finally, I'll structure the SQL query to return a single count of accounts that match these criteria.",
