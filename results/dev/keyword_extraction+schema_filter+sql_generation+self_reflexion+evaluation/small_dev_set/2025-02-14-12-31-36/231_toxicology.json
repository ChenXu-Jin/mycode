Next, I need to count the occurrence of each bond type for TR018. Since I need to determine which bond type accounted for the majority of the bonds, I will group by 'bond_type' and use the COUNT function to get the number of occurrences for each bond type. To identify the predominant bond type, I will order the results by this count in descending order and limit the results to the top one. Lastly, I also need to check if molecule TR018 is carcinogenic, which can be found in the 'label' column of the 'molecule' table. The result should return the bond type that has the maximum count and the carcinogenic label of the molecule in a single query.",
