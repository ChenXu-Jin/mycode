You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Question: 
Which bond type accounted for the majority of the bonds found in molecule TR018 and state whether or not this molecule is carcinogenic? 

Hint:
TR018 is the molecule id; majority of the bond found refers to MAX(COUNT(bond_type)); label = '+' mean molecules are carcinogenic; label = '-' means molecules are non-carcinogenic

Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure that you include a field in the SELECT statement that indicates whether the molecule TR018 is carcinogenic. You may need to join the 'molecule' table on a different column that includes the carcinogenicity information. For example, if there is a 'carcinogenic' boolean field in the 'molecule' table, add it to the SELECT clause: 'SELECT T1.bond_type, T2.label, T2.carcinogenic'. 2. If the carcinogenicity is stored in a different table, you may need to perform an additional JOIN with that table to retrieve the carcinogenicity status of the molecule. 3. Finally, ensure you handle any potential NULL values appropriately, so that the query does not fail if the information is missing. The revised query should look something like: 'SELECT T1.bond_type, T2.label, T2.carcinogenic FROM bond AS T1 JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T2.molecule_id = 'TR018' GROUP BY T1.bond_type, T2.carcinogenic ORDER BY COUNT(T1.bond_type) DESC LIMIT 1;'.

6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure that you include a field in the SELECT statement that indicates whether the molecule TR018 is carcinogenic. You may need to join the 'molecule' table on a different column that includes the carcinogenicity information. For example, if there is a 'carcinogenic' boolean field in the 'molecule' table, add it to the SELECT clause: 'SELECT T1.bond_type, T2.label, T2.carcinogenic'. 2. If the carcinogenicity is stored in a different table, you may need to perform an additional JOIN with that table to retrieve the carcinogenicity status of the molecule. 3. Finally, ensure you handle any potential NULL values appropriately, so that the query does not fail if the information is missing. The revised query should look something like: 'SELECT T1.bond_type, T2.label, T2.carcinogenic FROM bond AS T1 JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T2.molecule_id = 'TR018' GROUP BY T1.bond_type, T2.carcinogenic ORDER BY COUNT(T1.bond_type) DESC LIMIT 1;'. This ensures that you are capturing both the bond type and the carcinogenic status of the molecule.
7. To modify the SQL query and ensure it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Include the carcinogenicity information in the SELECT clause. You might need to ensure that the molecule table contains a column indicating carcinogenicity (e.g., 'is_carcinogenic'). 2. Adjust the JOIN to ensure you're also retrieving this carcinogenicity data along with the bond type. 3. Modify the GROUP BY clause as necessary to avoid any SQL errors related to selectivity. The updated SQL could look something like this: 

```sql
SELECT T1.bond_type, T2.is_carcinogenic 
FROM bond AS T1 
JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id 
WHERE T2.molecule_id = 'TR018' 
GROUP BY T1.bond_type, T2.is_carcinogenic 
ORDER BY COUNT(T1.bond_type) DESC 
LIMIT 1;
``` 

This assumes 'is_carcinogenic' is a valid column in the molecule table that indicates whether the molecule is carcinogenic. Ensure to adjust field names based on your actual database schema.

Question: 
Which bond type accounted for the majority of the bonds found in molecule TR018 and state whether or not this molecule is carcinogenic? 

Hint:
TR018 is the molecule id; majority of the bond found refers to MAX(COUNT(bond_type)); label = '+' mean molecules are carcinogenic; label = '-' means molecules are non-carcinogenic

Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure that you include a field in the SELECT statement that indicates whether the molecule TR018 is carcinogenic.
