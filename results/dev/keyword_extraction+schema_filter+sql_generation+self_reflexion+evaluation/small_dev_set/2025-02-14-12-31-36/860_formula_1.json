After finding the driverId, I then need to join with the 'drivers' table to retrieve the driver's nationality. Therefore, I will first select from the 'qualifying' table where raceId is 355 and Q2 time matches '0:01:40', and then get the corresponding nationality from the 'drivers' table by joining it on driverId. I will also ensure to only select the nationality as per the instructions.",
