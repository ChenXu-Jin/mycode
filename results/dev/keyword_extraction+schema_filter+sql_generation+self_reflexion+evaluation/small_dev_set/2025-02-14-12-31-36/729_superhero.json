The publisher table contains the names of publishers, and I need to filter for 'Marvel Comics'. The superhero table contains the height of each superhero. I'll use an INNER JOIN to connect these two tables based on the publisher_id in the superhero table that relates to the id in the publisher table. Since the question specifically asks for the average height, I will aggregate the height_cm using the AVG function. Additionally, I'll filter out any null height values to ensure accurate averaging.
