We need to filter the accounts based on the opening year (1996) and the district name (Litomerice). We will check the 'date' column in the 'account' table to identify the year and the 'A2' column in the 'district' table to match the district name. A join between the two tables is necessary because the 'account' table has 'district_id' which references the 'district' table. After formulating the join and applying the necessary filters, I will count the number of accounts that meet the criteria.",
