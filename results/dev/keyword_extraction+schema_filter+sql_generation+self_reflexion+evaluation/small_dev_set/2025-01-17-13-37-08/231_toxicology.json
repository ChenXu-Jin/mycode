Additionally, to check if the molecule is carcinogenic, I can include the label information from the molecule table which indicates whether the molecule is carcinogenic ('+' for carcinogenic and '-' for non-carcinogenic). I will use the COUNT function with GROUP BY to group the results by bond type, and then use ORDER BY and LIMIT to get the bond type with the highest count. The final output should include both the most common bond type and whether the molecule is carcinogenic or not without including any unnecessary columns. Hence, the query will involve counting the bond types of 'TR018', ordering them, and selecting the corresponding label indicating carcinogenicity.",
