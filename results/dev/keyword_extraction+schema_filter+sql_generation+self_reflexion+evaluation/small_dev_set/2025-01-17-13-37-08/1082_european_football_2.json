The 'League' table contains the league information, and the 'Country' table contains the country information. There is a foreign key relationship between these two tables via the 'country_id' in the 'League' table that links back to the 'Country' table. The question specifically points to obtaining information only related to Germany, which can be filtered using the condition 'Country.name = 'Germany''. Thus, I will join the 'League' and 'Country' tables and filter the results based on this condition. Given that the question asks for a list of leagues, I'll select the relevant league column(s) from the 'League' table. However, the instructions prompt that if a specific column isn't mentioned, I should prefer the id column over name. Therefore, the final query will select the id of the leagues associated with Germany.",
