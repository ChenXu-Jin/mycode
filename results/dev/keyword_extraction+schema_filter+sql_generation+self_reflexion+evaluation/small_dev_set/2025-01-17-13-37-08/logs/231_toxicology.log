You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Question: 
Which bond type accounted for the majority of the bonds found in molecule TR018 and state whether or not this molecule is carcinogenic?

Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure that both the bond type with the highest count and the carcinogenic status of the molecule are selected. Modify the SQL query to include an additional join with a table that contains the carcinogenic information. 2. Update the SELECT statement to retrieve the carcinogenic status.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure that both the bond type with the highest count and the carcinogenic status of the molecule are selected. Modify the SQL query to include an additional join with a table that contains the carcinogenic information. 2. Update the SELECT statement to retrieve the carcinogenic status. For instance, you might need to add something like 'T3.carcinogenic' to the SELECT statement, where T3 is the table containing the carcinogenic information. 3. Group by the bond type and ensure to also retrieve the carcinogenic status with a specific condition. You could do this by including 'T3.label' in the SELECT, while still using the correct grouping for bond type. 4. Confirm that the WHERE clause filters out the correct molecule 'TR018' and ensure that it appropriately references both bond and carcinogenic tables. Here’s an example of how your query might look after modifications: SELECT T1.bond_type, T2.label, T3.carcinogenic FROM bond T1 JOIN molecule T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id JOIN carcinogenic_table T3 ON T2.molecule_id = T3.molecule_id WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR018' GROUP BY T1.bond_type, T3.carcinogenic ORDER BY COUNT(T1.bond_type) DESC LIMIT 1;
7. The current SQL query does not return any results, suggesting that there might be no data available for the molecule TR018 in the database. To align the SQL query with the question's intent more effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Check Data Availability**: Before proceeding with the bond type analysis, ensure that molecule TR018 exists in the 'molecule' table. You could start with a simple query to verify the existence of this molecule:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM molecule WHERE molecule_id = 'TR018';
   ```

2. **Carcinogenicity Information**: The question asks whether molecule TR018 is carcinogenic. Make sure that the 'molecule' table contains a column that indicates carcinogenicity (e.g., 'is_carcinogenic'). Include this column in your SQL query to satisfy the request for carcinogenicity.

3. **Modify the SQL Query**: Assuming that there is a carcinogenicity column in the 'molecule' table, the query should integrate this information. Here's an adjusted version of the SQL query:
   ```sql
   SELECT T1.bond_type, T2.is_carcinogenic
   FROM bond T1
   JOIN molecule T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id
   WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR018'
   GROUP BY T1.bond_type, T2.is_carcinogenic
   ORDER BY COUNT(T1.bond_type) DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
   This will provide both the predominant bond type and the carcinogenicity status of molecule TR018.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling in your application code to manage scenarios where no results are found for a given molecule ID. This ensures the application can properly communicate a 'not found' message if TR018 does not exist.

In summary, verify the existence of the molecule, include carcinogenicity in your query, and adapt the SQL accordingly.

Question: 
Which bond type accounted for the majority of the bonds found in molecule TR018 and state whether or not this molecule is carcinogenic? 

Hint:
TR018 is the molecule id; majority of the bond found refers to MAX(COUNT(bond_type)); label = '+' mean molecules are carcinogenic; label = '-' means molecules are non-carcinogenic
