These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
For the driver who had the Q2 time as 0:01:40 in the qualifying race No. 355, what is his nationality?

SQL Query:
SELECT T2.nationality FROM qualifying T1 JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T1.raceId = 355 AND T1.q2 = '0:01:40';

Execution Result:
None

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
For the driver who had the Q2 time as 0:01:40 in the qualifying race No. 355, what is his nationality?

Predicted SQL:
SELECT T2.nationality FROM qualifying T1 JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T1.raceId = 355 AND T1.q2 = '0:01:40';

Execution Result:
None

Evaluation Result:

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "1. Verify Data Availability: First, check if there are any drivers recorded with a Q2 time of '0:01:40' for race ID 355. This can be done by executing a simple SELECT query on the qualifying table for that specific race and qualifying time: SELECT * FROM qualifying WHERE raceId = 355 AND q2 = '0:01:40';. If this returns no results, the question cannot be answered as it stands. \n\n2. Check Time Format and Values: Ensure that the time format used in the query matches the format stored in the database. If the database uses a different format (e.g., seconds or a different time string format), the query will not return results. Adjust the filtering condition accordingly. \n\n3. Confirm Table and Column Names: Check for any variations in the table or column names. If 'qualifying' and 'drivers' or the column names 'driverId', 'raceId', and 'q2' differ from what is expected, it could cause the query to return no results. Adjust the query to match the correct schema. \n\n4. Update the SQL Query: If drivers with the specified time do exist, ensure that the JOIN conditions are correctly set to link the 'qualifying' and 'drivers' tables properly. The query should look similar to: SELECT T2.nationality FROM qualifying T1 JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T1.raceId = 355 AND T1.q2 = '0:01:40'; (make modifications as needed based on data format discrepancies). \n\n5. Add Error Handling: Optionally, include error handling or a NULL check to report if no driver meets the criteria clearly, which is better for debugging and readability."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify Data Availability: First, check if there are any drivers recorded with a Q2 time of '0:01:40' for race ID 355. This can be done by executing a simple SELECT query on the qualifying table for that specific race and qualifying time: SELECT * FROM qualifying WHERE raceId = 355 AND q2 = '0:01:40';. If this returns no results, the question cannot be answered as it stands. 

2. Check Time Format and Values: Ensure that the time format used in the query matches the format stored in the database. If the database uses a different format (e.g., seconds or a different time string format), the query will not return results. Adjust the filtering condition accordingly. 

3. Confirm Table and Column Names: Check for any variations in the table or column names. If 'qualifying' and 'drivers' or the column names 'driverId', 'raceId', and 'q2' differ from what is expected, it could cause the query to return no results. Adjust the query to match the correct schema. 

4. Update the SQL Query: If drivers with the specified time do exist, ensure that the JOIN conditions are correctly set to link the 'qualifying' and 'drivers' tables properly. The query should look similar to: SELECT T2.nationality FROM qualifying T1 JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T1.raceId = 355 AND T1.q2 = '0:01:40'; (make modifications as needed based on data format discrepancies). 

5. Add Error Handling: Optionally, include error handling or a NULL check to report if no driver meets the criteria clearly, which is better for debugging and readability.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.

However, the execution result returned 'None', indicating no matching records were found in the database. This suggests that there may not be a driver matching the specified criteria, leading to a failure to provide the required information about nationality. Therefore, while the SQL query correctly addresses the question and is logically constructed to meet the requirements, the execution result indicates that the conditions may not correspond to any existing data. This results in the overall failure to provide a correct response, making the final judgment Invalid.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify Data Availability: First, check if there are any drivers recorded with a Q2 time of '0:01:40' for race ID 355. This can be done by executing a simple SELECT query on the qualifying table for that specific race and qualifying time: SELECT * FROM qualifying WHERE raceId = 355 AND q2 = '0:01:40';. If this returns no results, the question cannot be answered as it stands. 

2. Check Time Format and Values: Ensure that the time format used in the query matches the format stored in the database. If the database uses a different format (e.g., seconds or a different time string format), the query will not return results. Adjust the filtering condition accordingly. 

3. Confirm Table and Column Names: Check for any variations in the table or column names. If 'qualifying' and 'drivers' or the column names 'driverId', 'raceId', and 'q2' differ from what is expected, it could cause the query to return no results. Adjust the query to match the correct schema. 

4. Update the SQL Query: If drivers with the specified time do exist, ensure that the JOIN conditions are correctly set to link the 'qualifying' and 'drivers' tables properly. The query should look similar to: SELECT T2.nationality FROM qualifying T1 JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T1.raceId = 355 AND T1.q2 = '0:01:40'; (make modifications as needed based on data format discrepancies). 

5. Add Error Handling: Optionally, include error handling or a NULL check to report if no driver meets the criteria clearly, which is better for debugging and readability.
7. 1. Check the data: First, verify if there exists a record in the 'qualifying' table for 'raceId' 355 where the Q2 time is '0:01:40'. It is possible that no driver achieved this time, and hence the query returned 'None'.

2. Adjust the Time Format: Ensure that the time format in the database matches what you're querying against. If the Q2 time is stored as a time interval or in a different format, adjust the query accordingly to match the existing format.

3. Validate Driver IDs: Make sure that there are valid driver IDs in the database that correspond to the qualifying race. If there are discrepancies in 'driverId' between the two tables, consider validating them.

4. Refine the Query: If checking the data reveals that there should be an existing record, restructure the SQL query to include additional conditions or debugging information to uncover hidden issues. You could start with a broader query to understand the Q2 times available for race 355:
   ```sql
   SELECT T1.q2, T2.nationality 
   FROM qualifying T1 
   JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId 
   WHERE T1.raceId = 355;
   ```
   Review the output to see if '0:01:40' appears at all, and if not, respond accordingly.

5. Cross-check with Additional Races or Drivers: Consider revisiting other races or qualifying rounds if your investigation indicates that the queried data does not exist. This would provide context whether the result is isolated to race 355 or more widespread.
8. 1. Verify the timestamp format: Ensure that the format '0:01:40' used in the query matches the format of the Q2 time stored in the database. It may require converting the time to a different format or checking for leading zeros.

2. Check for existing data: Use a simple SELECT statement to query the qualifying table where raceId = 355 to see what Q2 times are actually stored, which will help confirm if '0:01:40' exists or if there's a typo or data anomaly.

3. Review Race and Q2 data: If the Q2 time '0:01:40' doesn’t exist, modify your query to include a range of times or adjust to check for similar times to ensure you retrieve a driver.

4. Add error handling: Consider adding conditions to handle cases where no matching records are found, such as returning a message like 'No driver found for the specified time and race.'

5. If running on a live application, double-check database connections and access rights, which can affect data retrieval.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T2.nationality FROM qualifying T1 JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T1.raceId = 355 AND T1.q2 = '0:01:40';", "SELECT T2.nationality FROM qualifying T1 JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T1.raceId = 355 AND T1.q2 = '0:01:40';", "SELECT T2.nationality FROM qualifying T1 JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T1.raceId = 355 AND T1.q2 = '0:01:40';", "SELECT T2.nationality FROM qualifying T1 JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T1.raceId = 355 AND T1.q2 = '0:01:40';", "SELECT T2.nationality FROM qualifying T1 JOIN drivers T2 ON T1.driverId = T2.driverId WHERE T1.raceId = 355 AND T1.q2 = '0:01:40';"]

Question: 
For the driver who had the Q2 time as 0:01:40 in the qualifying race No. 355, what is his nationality? 

Hint:
race number refers to raceId;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
