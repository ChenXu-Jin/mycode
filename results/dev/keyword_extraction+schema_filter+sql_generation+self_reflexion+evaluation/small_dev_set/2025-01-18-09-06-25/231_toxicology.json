I need to count the occurrences of each 'bond_type' for the bonds associated with 'TR018' using a group by clause. To determine which bond type has the maximum count, I will use an ORDER BY clause and a LIMIT of 1. Additionally, to identify whether the molecule is carcinogenic, I can directly check the 'label' from the 'molecule' table. Since we want the bond type and carcinogenicity state in a single query, I will select both pieces of information while ensuring to only include necessary columns as per the request.",
