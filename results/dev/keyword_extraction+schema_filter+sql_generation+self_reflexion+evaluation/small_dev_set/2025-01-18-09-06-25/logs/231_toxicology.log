You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Question: 
Which bond type accounted for the majority of the bonds found in molecule TR018 and state whether or not this molecule is carcinogenic? 

Hint:
TR018 is the molecule id; majority of the bond found refers to MAX(COUNT(bond_type)); label = '+' mean molecules are carcinogenic; label = '-' means molecules are non-carcinogenic

Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query and align it with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Introduce a left join with the 'carcinogenic' field from the 'molecule' table to retrieve information on whether molecule TR018 is carcinogenic. 2. Select the 'carcinogenic' field in addition to 'bond_type' in the SELECT clause. 3. Ensure that you do not group by any field that isn't directly related to the required bond type analysis. Modify the GROUP BY clause to include 'carcinogenic'.

Question: 
Which bond type accounted for the majority of the bonds found in molecule TR018 and state whether or not this molecule is carcinogenic? 

Hint:
TR018 is the molecule id; majority of the bond found refers to MAX(COUNT(bond_type)); label = '+' mean molecules are carcinogenic; label = '-' means molecules are non-carcinogenic

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query and align it with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Introduce a left join with the 'carcinogenic' field from the 'molecule' table to retrieve information on whether molecule TR018 is carcinogenic. 2. Select the 'carcinogenic' field in addition to 'bond_type' in the SELECT clause. 3. Ensure that you do not group by any field that isn't directly related to the required bond type analysis. Modify the GROUP BY clause to include 'carcinogenic'. The new SQL should look like: SELECT T2.bond_type, T1.carcinogenic FROM bond T2 JOIN molecule T1 ON T2.molecule_id = T1.molecule_id WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR018' GROUP BY T2.bond_type, T1.carcinogenic ORDER BY COUNT(T2.bond_type) DESC LIMIT 1; This adjustment retains the logic for determining the predominant bond type while also retrieving the carcinogenic status of the molecule.
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, you should first ensure that you include a check for the carcinogenicity of the molecule. Since the execution result indicates that information about carcinogenicity is not available in the current schema, you'll need to confirm if that data exists in the database and which table it can be found in. If it exists, you should join this additional table to retrieve the carcinogenicity status. Then, ensure to include it in the SELECT statement. 

Here’s a suggested approach: 
1. Examine the database schema for a table that might contain carcinogenicity information related to molecules. 
2. Include a join on that table in your query if available. If it is in a table like 'molecule_info', you would perform a join similar to this: 
   ``` 
   JOIN molecule_info T3 ON T1.molecule_id = T3.molecule_id 
   ``` 
3. Modify your SELECT statement to also retrieve the carcinogenicity column from this additional table, for example: 
   ``` 
   SELECT T2.bond_type, T1.label, T3.carcinogenic 
   ``` 
4. Confirm that you're grouping correctly by all non-aggregated fields in your SELECT statement so that the SQL query runs correctly. 
5. Adjust the final output further with `LIMIT 1` to ensure it focuses on the most common bond type and its carcinogenic status. 

The revised SQL query should resemble the following format (make sure to refine it based on actual table and column names): 
```sql 
SELECT T2.bond_type, T1.label, T3.carcinogenic 
FROM bond T2 
JOIN molecule T1 ON T2.molecule_id = T1.molecule_id 
JOIN molecule_info T3 ON T1.molecule_id = T3.molecule_id 
WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR018' 
GROUP BY T2.bond_type, T1.label, T3.carcinogenic 
ORDER BY COUNT(T2.bond_type) DESC 
LIMIT 1; 
``` 
6. If carcinogenicity information does not exist in the schema, you might need to rephrase the question based on available data or request access to additional information relevant to carcinogenicity.

Question: 
Which bond type accounted for the majority of the bonds found in molecule TR018 and state whether or not this molecule is carcinogenic? 

Hint:
TR018 is the molecule id; majority of the bond found refers to MAX(COUNT(bond_type)); label = '+' mean molecules are carcinogenic; label = '-' means molecules are non-carcinogenic
