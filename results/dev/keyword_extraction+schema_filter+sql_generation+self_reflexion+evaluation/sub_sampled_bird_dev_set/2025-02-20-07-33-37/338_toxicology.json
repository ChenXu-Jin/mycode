Then, I will filter the 'molecule' for 'molecule_id' equal to 'TR012'. Next, I must locate atoms with the element 'c' (for carbon) and ensure they are involved in bonds classified as a double bond (bond_type = ' = '). After filtering appropriately, I'll select the 'atom_id' of these atoms. Since the question specifically asks for the 'atom ID', I will only select that field in the final output.",
