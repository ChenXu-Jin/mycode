We will first link the 'molecule' table with the 'atom' table using the 'molecule_id'. Then, we need to link the 'bond' table using the connections that exist between atoms through the 'connected' table. This approach will allow us to retrieve the relevant 'element' from the 'atom' table and the 'bond_type' from the 'bond' table, filtering for only the specified molecule ID 'TR016'. We ensure that we only select the required columns (element and bond type) and avoid any null values in the bond type to keep our results accurate. Finally, we join the relevant tables with proper aliases to maintain clarity and conciseness in the SQL query.",
