First, we need to find the molecule_id for TR006 from the `molecule` table. Next, we will look for bonds in the `bond` table that are of type ' = ' (indicating double bonds) associated with that molecule_id. We can then count the number of double bonds. Simultaneously, we need to check the label of the molecule to determine if it is carcinogenic or not. Finally, we need to include the count of double bonds and the carcinogenic information in the result.",
