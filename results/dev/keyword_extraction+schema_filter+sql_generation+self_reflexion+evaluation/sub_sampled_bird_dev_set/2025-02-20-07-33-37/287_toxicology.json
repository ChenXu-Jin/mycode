We will filter the bonds using the condition 'molecule_id = 'TR047''. Next, we need to count the total number of bonds and the number of double bonds specifically. The double bond is indicated by 'bond_type = ' = ''. To compute the percentage, we can use the formula: (number of double bonds) / (total number of bonds) * 100. In SQLite, we can utilize the COUNT aggregate function alongside a conditional SUM to achieve this in one query. Additionally, since we only need the percentage, we only select this calculated percentage, omitting any extra columns.",
