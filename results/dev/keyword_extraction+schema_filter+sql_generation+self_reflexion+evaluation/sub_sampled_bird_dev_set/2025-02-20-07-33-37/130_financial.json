First, I will identify the district ID for South Bohemia from the 'district' table using the A3 column, which contains region names. Next, I will find the accounts within that district in the 'account' table. I will also access the 'disp' table to see if those accounts have any associated credit cards (cards). An account is considered to not own a credit card if there is no corresponding entry in the 'disp' table for that account ID. To find the result, I will count the number of accounts that match this criterion. Therefore, the SQL query will involve a LEFT JOIN between the 'account' and 'disp' tables to identify accounts without cards and then filter based on the district ID for South Bohemia.",
