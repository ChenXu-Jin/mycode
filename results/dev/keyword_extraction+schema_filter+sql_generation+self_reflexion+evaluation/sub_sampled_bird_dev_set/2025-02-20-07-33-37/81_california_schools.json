Since I'm interested in the lowest grade, I will also include 'Low Grade' from the frpm table, which provides information about the grade levels. I will join the frpm table based on the CDSCode to correlate the school details with the grade information. I will sort the data by latitude and limit the result to the first entry to get the school with the lowest latitude.
