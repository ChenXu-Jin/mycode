The school names will be derived from the 'schools' table, while SAT scores, particularly average math scores, will be extracted from the 'satscores' table. Since we want the average of the average math scores, I will need to apply a GROUP BY clause to group the results by school and then use a HAVING clause to filter schools that meet the required condition. After calculating the average math score and filtering, I'll select the school funding type from the schools' table. Both tables are linked via the 'CDSCode' field. Finally, I will ensure to remove any null values from the average math scores before the calculations. The final query will include only the school name and the funding type for the schools that meet the specified condition.",
