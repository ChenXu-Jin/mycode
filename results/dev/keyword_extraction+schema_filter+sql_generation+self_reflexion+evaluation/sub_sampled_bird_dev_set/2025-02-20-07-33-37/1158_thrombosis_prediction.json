This means I have to filter records from the `Patient` table based on the `Birthday` field. Next, I need to check the `Laboratory` table for the total cholesterol values associated with those patients, which requires joining the `Patient` and `Laboratory` tables based on the patient IDs. I will select the ID of the patients who meet both criteria. The final query will involve a JOIN operation, WHERE conditions to filter the birth year and the cholesterol levels, followed by selecting the patient IDs involved in this condition.",
