First, we will identify the district ID corresponding to 'Litomerice' from the 'district' table, focusing on the A2 column. Next, we will check the 'account' table to filter accounts where the 'district_id' matches the Litomerice district ID and the 'date' falls within 1996. Finally, we will count the number of accounts that meet these criteria. The SQL query will involve joining the 'account' table and 'district' table, filtering by the specified date and district name, and using the COUNT function to return the total number of accounts.",
