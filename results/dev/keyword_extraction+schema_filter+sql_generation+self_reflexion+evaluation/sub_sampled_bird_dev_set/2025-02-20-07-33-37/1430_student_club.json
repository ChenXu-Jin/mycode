The relevant table for the expense details is the 'expense' table, which includes both the description and date of the expense. To get the member's details, I will need to join the 'expense' table with the 'member' table using the link_to_member foreign key relation. The next step is to filter the expenses to find the specific purchase of pizza on 09/10/2019 (which translates to the date '2019-09-10'). After retrieving the correct record, I will select the last name and position of the respective member. I will denote the expense table as T1 and the member table as T2 for clarity in the SQL query. Lastly, since there is only one specific transaction we're interested in, I won't need to include an ORDER BY clause or any LIMIT statements. The final query will retrieve the necessary columns from the joined tables.",
