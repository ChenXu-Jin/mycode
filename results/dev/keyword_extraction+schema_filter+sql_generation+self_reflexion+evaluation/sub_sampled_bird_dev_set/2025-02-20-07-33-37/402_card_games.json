Story Spotlight cards are identified by the column 'isStorySpotlight' equal to 1. Next, to find those that have a text box, the condition 'isTextless' should be equal to 0. To find the total number of Story Spotlight cards and the number of those that have a text box, I can use the SUM function with conditional counts. The percentage can be calculated by dividing the count of Story Spotlight cards with a text box by the total count of Story Spotlight cards and multiplying it by 100. The final requirement is to output the IDs of these cards. The final SQL query should focus on selecting the percentage calculated along with the IDs of the cards that meet the criteria.
