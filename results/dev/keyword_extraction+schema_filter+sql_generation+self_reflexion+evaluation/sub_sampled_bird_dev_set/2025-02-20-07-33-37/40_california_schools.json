Filter the results to only include schools within the 'Fresno Unified' district.\n4. Sort the results by the average reading score in ascending order to find the lowest score.\n5. Select the telephone number of that school using an ORDER BY clause in combination with LIMIT 1 to get just the top result. \nThus, the final SQL query will retrieve the telephone number associated with the school that meets all these criteria.",
