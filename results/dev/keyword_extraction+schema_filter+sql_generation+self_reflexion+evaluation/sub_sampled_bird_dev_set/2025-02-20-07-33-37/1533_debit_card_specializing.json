This requires calculating the price per unit, which is the Price divided by Amount for each transaction of the specified product. Then, we'll filter for those transactions where this calculated price exceeds 29.00. Once we have the relevant transactions, we need to check the corresponding customer IDs to retrieve their consumption status from the yearmonth table for August 2012, specified by the date format containing '201208'. We will join the transactions table with the yearmonth table through CustomerID to get the consumption information. The final SQL will select the CustomerID for these conditions. We\u2019ll use aliases for the tables to simplify the SQL syntax, and we\u2019ll make sure to filter out any null values where applicable.",
