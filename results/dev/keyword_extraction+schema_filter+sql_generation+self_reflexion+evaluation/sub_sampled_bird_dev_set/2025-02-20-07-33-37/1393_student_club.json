The relevant table for members is the 'member' table, which contains columns for first name, last name, email, and position. Since we're not asked for specific changes to how the name is combined, I will select 'first_name', 'last_name', and 'email'. The condition specifies the member's position as 'Secretary', so I will include a WHERE clause to filter by position. As there's no direct relation noted to denote 'Student Club', I will assume 'Secretary' suffices to narrow down the member. The output will only contain the columns specified - first name, last name, and email - as required by the query.",
