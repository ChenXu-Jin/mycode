Revenue can be calculated by summing the 'Price' multiplied by the 'Amount' from the 'transactions_1k' table, grouped by the gas station. Next, we need to join the 'gasstations' table to associate the revenue with the specific gas station. To get the gas station with the highest revenue, we will order the results in descending order of the calculated revenue and limit the output to only one record to get the highest value. We will select the 'GasStationID' as it is the preferred column to return based on the instructions.",
