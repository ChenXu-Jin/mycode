In the schema, the 'side' column indicates whether a card has multiple faces; we want to filter out those with a non-null 'side'. We also need to select the 'artist' column for the illustrator of the card. The highest converted mana cost can be retrieved using an ORDER BY clause combined with LIMIT 1. Therefore, the query will select the 'artist' from the 'cards' table, applying the conditions appropriately and ordering by 'convertedManaCost' in descending order. Finally, we'll ensure to select only the relevant columns as specified in the question.",
