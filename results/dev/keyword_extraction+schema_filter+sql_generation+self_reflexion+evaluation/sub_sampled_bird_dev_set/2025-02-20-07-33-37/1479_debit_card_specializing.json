The consumption data is located in the 'yearmonth' table, which contains the 'Consumption' column for each customer and year combination. I need to filter results based on the currency 'CZK', which is found in the 'customers' table. To aggregate the data correctly, I will sum the consumption by year. The year can be extracted from the 'Date' column (the first 4 characters represent the year). I'll join the 'customers' and 'yearmonth' tables on 'CustomerID' to incorporate the currency filter. Finally, I will sort the results by total consumption in descending order and limit to the top result to get the year with the maximum consumption. Overall, the SQL query will involve joining the relevant tables, filtering for 'CZK', extracting the year, summing consumption, and ordering for the top result.",
