This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query in order to fully answer the question about the highest total bilirubin level recorded, you need to: 1. Select the maximum total bilirubin level from the Laboratory table along with the corresponding patient details in a single result set. 2. Use a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first obtain the maximum total bilirubin level, then join that result back with the Patient table to get the required patient information. Here’s a suggested modification: SELECT T1."T-BIL", T2.ID, T2.SEX, T2.Birthday FROM Laboratory AS T1 JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1."T-BIL" = (SELECT MAX("T-BIL") FROM Laboratory WHERE "T-BIL" IS NOT NULL) AND T1."T-BIL" IS NOT NULL. This will ensure that you retrieve both the highest bilirubin level and the associated patient details.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T2.ID, T2.SEX, T2.Birthday FROM Laboratory AS T1 JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1."T-BIL" IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1."T-BIL" DESC LIMIT 1']

Question: 
What is the highest total bilirubin level recorded? List out the patient details with ID, sex and birthday with that index. 

Hint:
the highest total bilirubin refers to MAX(T-BIL)

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
What is the highest total bilirubin level recorded? List out the patient details with ID, sex and birthday with that index.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1."T-BIL", T2.ID, T2.SEX, T2.Birthday FROM Laboratory AS T1 JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1."T-BIL" = (SELECT MAX("T-BIL") FROM Laboratory WHERE "T-BIL" IS NOT NULL) AND T1."T-BIL" IS NOT NULL;

Database Content:
{'Examination': ['ID', 'Examination Date', 'aCL IgG', 'aCL IgM', 'ANA', 'ANA Pattern', 'aCL IgA', 'Diagnosis', 'KCT', 'RVVT', 'LAC', 'Symptoms', 'Thrombosis'], 'Patient': ['ID', 'SEX', 'Birthday', 'Description', 'First Date', 'Admission', 'Diagnosis'], 'Laboratory': ['ID', 'Date', 'GOT', 'GPT', 'LDH', 'ALP', 'TP', 'ALB', 'UA', 'UN', 'CRE', 'T-BIL', 'T-CHO', 'TG', 'CPK', 'GLU', 'WBC', 'RBC', 'HGB', 'HCT', 'PLT', 'PT', 'APTT', 'FG', 'PIC', 'TAT', 'TAT2', 'U-PRO', 'IGG', 'IGA', 'IGM', 'CRP', 'RA', 'RF', 'C3', 'C4', 'RNP', 'SM', 'SC170', 'SSA', 'SSB', 'CENTROMEA', 'DNA', 'DNA-II']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "First, I analyzed the question, which asks for the highest total bilirubin level recorded and wants details of the patients associated with that value, specifically their ID, sex, and birthday. The SQL query is designed to achieve this by joining the Laboratory table, which contains the 'T-BIL' (total bilirubin level), with the Patient table based on matching IDs. It correctly identifies the highest 'T-BIL' by using a subquery that fetches the maximum value while ensuring the 'T-BIL' level is not null. This logic aligns well with the question's requirements. The SQL query selects the relevant columns: 'T-BIL', `ID`, `SEX`, and `Birthday`, which are all necessary to answer the question. Therefore, upon execution, if the query returns the expected patient details corresponding to the maximum 'T-BIL', it would satisfy the question's intent. Based on this reasoning, if correctly formulated, the SQL query should be valid as it meets the question's requirements completely.",

Question:
What is the highest total bilirubin level recorded? List out the patient details with ID, sex and birthday with that index.

Incorrect SQL:
SELECT T2.ID, T2.SEX, T2.Birthday FROM Laboratory AS T1 JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1."T-BIL" IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1."T-BIL" DESC LIMIT 1

Correct SQL:
SELECT T1."T-BIL", T2.ID, T2.SEX, T2.Birthday FROM Laboratory AS T1 JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1."T-BIL" = (SELECT MAX("T-BIL") FROM Laboratory WHERE "T-BIL" IS NOT NULL) AND T1."T-BIL" IS NOT NULL;
