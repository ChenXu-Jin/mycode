This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of finding the oldest mythic card's release date and its legal play formats, follow these steps: 1. First, identify the UUID of the oldest mythic card using a subquery that retrieves the minimum release date for mythic rarity cards. This ensures you specifically target the oldest card. 2. Use this UUID to join with the 'legalities' table to obtain the legal formats associated with that specific card. 3. Ensure to select the release date and legal formats in a manner that accurately connects the two pieces of information. Here's a revised SQL query: 

SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format 
FROM cards T1 
JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid 
WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT T3.uuid FROM cards T3 WHERE T3.rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY T3.originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1) AND T2.status = 'legal';

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT MIN(T1.originalReleaseDate), T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.rarity = 'mythic' AND T2.status = 'legal';"]

Question: 
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats? 

Hint:
the oldest card refers to MIN(originalReleaseDate); mythic card refers to rarity = 'mythic'; legal play refers to status = 'legal'; play format refers to format

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Input Data

Question:
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats?

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT T3.uuid FROM cards T3 WHERE T3.rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY T3.originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1) AND T2.status = 'legal';

Database Content:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for two pieces of information: the release date of the oldest mythic card and the legal play formats for that card. The SQL query is structured to get the original release date from the 'cards' table (T1) and the legal formats from the 'legalities' table (T2) by performing a join on the `uuid` field. The subquery correctly identifies the uuid of the oldest mythic card by ordering the records by `originalReleaseDate` and limiting the result to the first entry. The join then filters the legal formats by ensuring the status is 'legal'. This matches the requirements of the question.
