This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so it accurately aligns with the question's intent of counting high-level credit cards that have a 'disponent' type of disposition, consider the following steps: 1. Clarify the Definition of 'High-Level': Determine if there are specific card types other than 'gold' that qualify as 'high-level' credit cards. If there are additional types, include them in the query. 2. Modify WHERE Clause: Adjust the WHERE clause to include all relevant high-level card types. For example, if 'gold', 'platinum', and 'diamond' are considered high-level, rewrite the condition to reflect this: `WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'diamond')`. 3. Confirm Disposition Types: Ensure that 'disponent' is indeed the type of disposition you want to filter by and that it is represented correctly in the 'disp' table. 4. Update the SQL Query: The modified SQL query might look like this: `SELECT COUNT(T1.card_id) FROM card T1 JOIN disp T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'diamond') AND T2.type = 'disponent';`. This query counts all high-level credit cards associated with the 'disponent' disposition type.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it accurately counts all high-level credit cards with a 'disponent' type of disposition, follow these steps: 1. Review the database schema to identify all types of high-level credit cards, which may include more than just 'gold.' Replace the condition that filters for T1.type = 'gold' with a condition that includes all relevant high-level credit card types. This can be done using an 'IN' clause, such as 'T1.type IN (...list_of_high_level_types...)' or by excluding specific conditions until clear definitions are known. 2. Ensure that the join condition correctly references the disposition table. 3. After adjusting the card type filter, test the updated query to confirm it returns a valid count. The revised SQL might look something like: SELECT COUNT(T1.card_id) FROM card T1 JOIN disp T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'black') AND T2.type = 'disponent'; 4.
