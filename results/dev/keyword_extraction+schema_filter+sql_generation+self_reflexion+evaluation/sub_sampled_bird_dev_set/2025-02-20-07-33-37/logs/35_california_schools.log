This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "feedback": "1. Confirm the Correct Column Name: Verify the names of the columns in the 'frpm' table to ensure that 'Enrollment (K-12)' is indeed the correct name. It seems there may be a discrepancy, so adjusting the column name as necessary is critical.\n\n2. Ensure Proper Filtering: The query currently uses `WHERE T2.'Charter School (Y/N)' = 1`. Ensure that the condition is filtering correctly for charter schools. If false values exist in the dataset, this could affect the outcome.\n\n3.

Consider using a subquery to first select the school with the minimum enrollment, and then join that result to fetch the email address.\n\n4. Rewrite the Query: An improved query could look like:\n   \n   SELECT T1.AdmEmail1 \n   FROM schools AS T1 \n   JOIN frpm AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode \n   WHERE T2.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 \n   AND T2.`Enrollment (K-12)` = (SELECT MIN(T3.`Enrollment (K-12)`) FROM frpm AS T3 WHERE T3.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1); \n\n5.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Confirm the Correct Column Name: Verify the names of the columns in the 'frpm' table to ensure that 'Enrollment (K-12)' is indeed the correct name. It seems there may be a discrepancy, so adjusting the column name as necessary is critical.

2. Ensure Proper Filtering: The query currently uses `WHERE T2.'Charter School (Y/N)' = 1`. Ensure that the condition is filtering correctly for charter schools. If false values exist in the dataset, this could affect the outcome.

3. Adjust the SQL Query for Clarity: Instead of relying on an ambiguous ORDER BY with filtering, use an aggregate function to find the minimum enrollment directly. Consider using a subquery to first select the school with the minimum enrollment, and then join that result to fetch the email address.

4. Rewrite the Query: An improved query could look like:
   
   SELECT T1.AdmEmail1 
   FROM schools AS T1 
   JOIN frpm AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode 
   WHERE T2.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 
   AND T2.`Enrollment (K-12)` = (SELECT MIN(T3.`Enrollment (K-12)`) FROM frpm AS T3 WHERE T3.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1); 

5. Test the Query: After making the changes, test the query against the database to ensure that it returns the correct email address of the administrator of the chartered school with the fewest students enrolled in grades 1 through 12.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT AdmEmail1 FROM schools AS T1 JOIN frpm AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T2.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 ORDER BY T2.`Enrollment (K-12)` ASC LIMIT 1;']

Question: 
What is the administrator's email address of the chartered school with the fewest students enrolled in grades 1 through 12? 

Hint:
Charted school means `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 in the table frpm; Students enrolled in grades 1 through 12 refers to `Enrollment (K-12)`

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To construct the SQL query that retrieves the administrator's email address of the chartered school with the fewest students enrolled in grades 1 through 12, I need to consider several key points. First, I specify that the school must be a chartered school, which is indicated by the `Charter School (Y/N)` column being equal to 1 in the 'frpm' table.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure the proper association between the schools and their enrollment data by modifying the subquery to return the enrollment value specifically from the 'frpm' table. 2. Instead of using a direct comparison in the WHERE clause for 'Enrollment (K-12)', filter the results based on a derived table that identifies the minimum enrollment school directly related to the schools' details. 3. Use a common table expression (CTE) or a derived table to first calculate the minimum enrollment value per charter school and then join it back to both tables to ensure that you're looking for the email from the correct school record. Here’s a revised SQL query: 

WITH MinEnrollment AS (  
    SELECT T2.CDSCode, MIN(T2.`Enrollment (K-12)`) AS MinEnroll FROM frpm AS T2  
    WHERE T2.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1  
    GROUP BY T2.CDSCode  
)  
SELECT T1.AdmEmail1  
FROM schools AS T1  
JOIN MinEnrollment AS ME ON T1.CDSCode = ME.CDSCode  
WHERE ME.MinEnroll = (SELECT MIN(MinEnroll) FROM MinEnrollment)  
LIMIT 1;

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT AdmEmail1 FROM schools AS T1 JOIN frpm AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T2.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 ORDER BY T2.`Enrollment (K-12)` ASC LIMIT 1;', 'SELECT T1.AdmEmail1 FROM schools AS T1 JOIN frpm AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T2.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND T2.`Enrollment (K-12)` = (SELECT MIN(T3.`Enrollment (K-12)`) FROM frpm AS T3 WHERE T3.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1);', 'SELECT T1.AdmEmail1 FROM schools AS T1 JOIN frpm AS T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode WHERE T2.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND T2.`Enrollment (K-12)` = (SELECT MIN(T3.`Enrollment (K-12)`) FROM frpm AS T3 WHERE T3.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1) LIMIT 1;']

Question: 
What is the administrator's email address of the chartered school with the fewest students enrolled in grades 1 through 12? 

Hint:
Charted school means `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 in the table frpm; Students enrolled in grades 1 through 12 refers to `Enrollment (K-12)`

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
