This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the intent of the question, follow these steps: 1. Remove the 'id' from the SELECT clause as it is not needed for calculating the overall percentage. 2. Instead of grouping by 'id', perform a count of 'Story Spotlight' cards that are not textless. 3. Use a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) to get the total number of 'Story Spotlight' cards as well as the count of such cards with a text box, and then calculate the percentage based on those counts. Here is a revised version of the query: 

```
WITH SpotlightCards AS (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalCards,
           COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 END) AS textBoxCards
    FROM cards
    WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1
)
SELECT (textBoxCards * 100.0 / totalCards) AS percentage
FROM SpotlightCards;
```
4. Ensure that your query results are specifically aimed at the percentage calculations rather than individual card IDs.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage, id FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1 GROUP BY id;']

Question: 
What is the percentage of Story Spotlight cards that also have a text box? List them by their ID. 

Hint:
Story Spotlight cards that do not have a text box refers to isStorylight = 1 and isTextless = 1; Percentage refer to DIVIDE(SUM(count(id) where isStorylight = 1), SUM(count(id))) * 100



Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.

2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Remove the aggregation in the CTE: Instead of grouping by ID and counting total cards and text box cards in aggregate, select each card's ID individually. 2. Directly select the IDs of the Story Spotlight cards and determine if each has a text box within the main query. Use a CASE statement to check 'isTextless' for calculating the percentage. 3. Ensure the final output includes both the card ID and the corresponding percentage of having a text box calculated for each individual card. The revised SQL should resemble this structure: 

SELECT id, (CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS hasTextBox, 
(100.0 * (CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / 1) AS percentage 
FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1;

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)) AS percentage, id FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1 GROUP BY id;', 'WITH SpotlightCards AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalCards, COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 END) AS textBoxCards FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1) SELECT (textBoxCards * 100.0 / totalCards) AS percentage FROM SpotlightCards;', 'WITH SpotlightCards AS (SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS totalCards, COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 END) AS textBoxCards FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1 GROUP BY id) SELECT id, (textBoxCards * 100.0 / totalCards) AS percentage FROM SpotlightCards;']

Question: 
What is the percentage of Story Spotlight cards that also have a text box? List them by their ID. 

Hint:
Story Spotlight cards that do not have a text box refers to isStorylight = 1 and isTextless = 1; Percentage refer to DIVIDE(SUM(count(id) where isStorylight = 1), SUM(count(id))) * 100



Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

The key criteria include filtering on 'isStorySpotlight = 1' to select only Story Spotlight cards and checking 'isTextless = 0' to determine those that have a text box. The percentage calculation involves finding the count of Story Spotlight cards having a text box in relation to the total count of Story Spotlight cards. I will use a SQL query structure that selects the card ID while calculating the percentage of cards that have a text box utilizing a CASE statement to evaluate 'isTextless'. By ensuring the correct formula for the percentage calculation is employed, I can derive the expected results more straightforwardly.
