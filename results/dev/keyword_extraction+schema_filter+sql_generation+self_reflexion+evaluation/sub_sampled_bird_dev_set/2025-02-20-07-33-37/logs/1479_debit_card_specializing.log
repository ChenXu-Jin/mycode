You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE customers (
  CustomerID INTEGER UNIQUE     not null
        primary key,
  Segment    TEXT null,
  Currency   TEXT null
);

CREATE TABLE gasstations (
  GasStationID INTEGER    UNIQUE   not null
        primary key,
  ChainID      INTEGER          null,
  Country      TEXT null,
  Segment      TEXT null
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  ProductID   INTEGER   UNIQUE      not null
        primary key,
  Description TEXT null
);

CREATE TABLE transactions_1k (
  TransactionID INTEGER
        primary key autoincrement,
  Date          DATE,
  Time          TEXT,
  CustomerID    INTEGER,
  CardID        INTEGER,
  GasStationID  INTEGER,

);

CREATE TABLE yearmonth (
  CustomerID  INTEGER not null
        references customers
            on update cascade on delete cascade
        references customers,
  Date        TEXT    not null,
  Consumption REAL,
  primary key (Date, CustomerID)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###

Add specific filters: Ensure that the WHERE clause distinctly captures gas consumption records tied to payments made in CZK. This could involve adding additional conditions to isolate transactions in CZK currency to aggregate appropriately. 4. Adjust join conditions: If necessary, modify the join conditions to ensure accurate relationships between the relevant tables to properly reflect gas payments. After applying these changes, the revised SQL might resemble: `SELECT SUBSTR(T2.Date, 1, 4) AS Year, SUM(T2.PaymentAmount) AS TotalPaid FROM payments T2 JOIN transactions T3 ON T2.TransactionID = T3.TransactionID JOIN customers T1 ON T3.CustomerID = T1.CustomerID WHERE T1.Currency = 'CZK' AND T3.Type = 'Gas' GROUP BY Year ORDER BY TotalPaid DESC LIMIT 1;` Ensure you replace 'PaymentAmount' and the relevant table naming according to your actual database structure.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Which year recorded the most consumption of gas paid in CZK?

SQL Query:
SELECT SUBSTR(T2.Date, 1, 4) AS Year, SUM(T2.Consumption) AS TotalConsumption FROM yearmonth T2 JOIN customers T1 ON T2.CustomerID = T1.CustomerID WHERE T1.Currency = 'CZK' GROUP BY Year ORDER BY TotalConsumption DESC LIMIT 1;

Database Content:
{'customers': ['CustomerID', 'Segment', 'Currency'], 'gasstations': ['GasStationID', 'ChainID', 'Country', 'Segment'], 'products': ['ProductID', 'Description'], 'transactions_1k': ['TransactionID', 'Date', 'Time', 'CustomerID', 'CardID', 'GasStationID', 'ProductID', 'Amount', 'Price'], 'yearmonth': ['CustomerID', 'Date', 'Consumption']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the year that recorded the most consumption of gas paid in CZK. The SQL query attempts to retrieve this information by selecting the year from the date field and summing the gas consumption for customers whose currency is CZK. The SQL query uses the 'yearmonth' table to connect customers with their consumption data through a join with the 'customers' table. The GROUP BY clause groups results by year, and it orders the total consumption in descending order, limiting the result to the top entry. All relevant conditions and aggregations appear to be correctly applied. However, the query lacks a direct reference to the 'transactions_1k' table, which may include relevant transaction details about the consumption. The execution result should provide a single year, the one with the maximum gas consumption in CZK.. Having considered the SQL construction, its purpose aligns with the question. Thus, I conclude the SQL logic is sound despite excluding transactions that might influence consumption. Therefore, the outcome corresponds with the question's intent.",
