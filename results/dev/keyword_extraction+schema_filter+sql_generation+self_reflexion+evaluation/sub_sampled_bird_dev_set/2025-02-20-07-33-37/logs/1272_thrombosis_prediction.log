Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Which patient is the first patient with an abnormal anti-SSA to come to the hospital? Please give his or her ID.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Which patient is the first patient with an abnormal anti-SSA to come to the hospital? Please give his or her ID.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SSA NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY T1.`First Date` LIMIT 1;

Database Content:
{'Examination': ['ID', 'Examination Date', 'aCL IgG', 'aCL IgM', 'ANA', 'ANA Pattern', 'aCL IgA', 'Diagnosis', 'KCT', 'RVVT', 'LAC', 'Symptoms', 'Thrombosis'], 'Patient': ['ID', 'SEX', 'Birthday', 'Description', 'First Date', 'Admission', 'Diagnosis'], 'Laboratory': ['ID', 'Date', 'GOT', 'GPT', 'LDH', 'ALP', 'TP', 'ALB', 'UA', 'UN', 'CRE', 'T-BIL', 'T-CHO', 'TG', 'CPK', 'GLU', 'WBC', 'RBC', 'HGB', 'HCT', 'PLT', 'PT', 'APTT', 'FG', 'PIC', 'TAT', 'TAT2', 'U-PRO', 'IGG', 'IGA', 'IGM', 'CRP', 'RA', 'RF', 'C3', 'C4', 'RNP', 'SM', 'SC170', 'SSA', 'SSB', 'CENTROMEA', 'DNA', 'DNA-II']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the ID of the first patient who has an abnormal anti-SSA result. The SQL query attempts to join the Patient and Laboratory tables and filters results based on the SSA column values being neither '-' nor '+-'. The query orders results by the patient's 'First Date' and limits the output to one record, which aligns with the question\u2019s request for identifying the 'first patient'. However, it is crucial to ensure that the query accurately reflects an abnormal SSA. The notation for abnormal SSA is not clearly defined; assuming normal to be represented as '-' and '+-' indicates potential results to be excluded, but there could be other values that could represent abnormal results not accounted for in the specific filtering condition.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it accurately identifies the first patient with an abnormal anti-SSA result, follow these steps: 1. Clarify the definition of 'abnormal' SSA results with your data provider. Ensure you have a complete understanding of which values in the SSA column are considered abnormal and should be included. 2. Adjust the WHERE clause to include all identified abnormal SSA values instead of just excluding '-' and '+-'. For example, if '0', '1+', or other specific codes denote abnormal results, include them as part of the WHERE clause using an 'IN' clause or appropriate logic. 3. Ensure that the ORDER BY clause is applied correctly to reflect the 'First Date' of visit accurately. You might want to confirm that 'First Date' is the correct column to determine the first visit rather than the earliest date in the database. The modified query should look something like this: `SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SSA IN ('<list_of_abnormal_values>') ORDER BY T1.`First Date` LIMIT 1;`.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure the SQL query accurately identifies the first patient with an abnormal anti-SSA result, the following modifications should be made: 1. **Update the filtering logic for SSA values:** Review and expand the filtering criteria in the WHERE clause to include all potential abnormal anti-SSA values. For example, instead of checking for only `NOT IN ('-', '+-')`, consider including any known abnormal results (e.g., `WHERE T2.SSA IN ('abnormal_value1', 'abnormal_value2', ...)`). Ensure to consult with clinical definitions of abnormal values to populate this list. 2. **Ensure date field relevance:** Verify that the `First Date` field is the correct field representing the patient's first admission to the hospital. If there's another field that more accurately captures the relevant admission or test date, use that field for ordering. 3. **Clarify the join condition:** Make sure the join condition between the Patient and Laboratory tables is sufficient to ensure that you're only considering patient records that have corresponding laboratory results. This might need the addition of filtering based on necessary attributes or dates. 4. **Return more data if needed:** If required, modify the select statement to include other identifiers (such as a name or birthdate) to aid in validating the first patient found. After implementing these changes, re-evaluate the query to confirm it meets the intended goal.

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query to accurately align with the question's intent of identifying the first patient with an abnormal anti-SSA test result, follow these steps: 1. **Define Abnormal Values:** Instead of using the filters `NOT IN ('-', '+-')`, specify the actual criteria for abnormal anti-SSA results. You may need to consult medical guidelines or data definitions to determine normal versus abnormal thresholds. For example, if the abnormal values are greater than a certain numerical value, revise the WHERE clause accordingly, like `WHERE T2.SSA >= threshold_value`. 2. **Use Correct Date for Ordering:** Ensure that the ordering is based on the correct date of examination rather than the 'First Date' from the Patient table. If the Laboratory table contains a date column (e.g., `T2.LabDate`), modify the ORDER BY clause to use this column. This guarantees that you are considering the actual date of the SSA test when identifying the first tested patient. 3. **Limit Clause Adjustment:** Retain the `LIMIT 1` to only return the first record, but ensure that the ordering properly reflects the chronological order of visits related to abnormal results. 4. **Final Query Structure:** The modified SQL may look like: `SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SSA >= threshold_value ORDER BY T2.LabDate LIMIT 1;` Adjust 'threshold_value' to reflect the correct abnormality threshold as per the medical context."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to accurately align with the question's intent of identifying the first patient with an abnormal anti-SSA test result, follow these steps: 1. **Define Abnormal Values:** Instead of using the filters `NOT IN ('-', '+-')`, specify the actual criteria for abnormal anti-SSA results. You may need to consult medical guidelines or data definitions to determine normal versus abnormal thresholds. For example, if the abnormal values are greater than a certain numerical value, revise the WHERE clause accordingly, like `WHERE T2.SSA >= threshold_value`. 2. **Use Correct Date for Ordering:** Ensure that the ordering is based on the correct date of examination rather than the 'First Date' from the Patient table. If the Laboratory table contains a date column (e.g., `T2.LabDate`), modify the ORDER BY clause to use this column. This guarantees that you are considering the actual date of the SSA test when identifying the first tested patient. 3. **Limit Clause Adjustment:** Retain the `LIMIT 1` to only return the first record, but ensure that the ordering properly reflects the chronological order of visits related to abnormal results. 4. **Final Query Structure:** The modified SQL may look like: `SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SSA >= threshold_value ORDER BY T2.LabDate LIMIT 1;` Adjust 'threshold_value' to reflect the correct abnormality threshold as per the medical context.

["SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SSA NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY T1.`First Date` LIMIT 1;", "SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SSA NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY T1.`First Date` LIMIT 1;", "SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SSA NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY T1.`First Date` LIMIT 1;"]

Question: 
Which patient is the first patient with an abnormal anti-SSA to come to the hospital? Please give his or her ID. 

Hint:
first patient refers to ID with MIN(`First Date`); abnormal anti-SSA refers to SSA NOT IN('-', '+-');

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To construct the SQL query for finding the first patient with an abnormal anti-SSA test result, I need to consider the following: 1. Define what constitutes 'abnormal' for anti-SSA, which is indicated in the question as values that are NOT IN ('-', '+-'). 2. Identify the patient data by joining the Patient table and the Laboratory table on the patient ID. 3. Since we are interested in the 'first' patient based on the date they first came to the hospital, I will use the `First Date` column from the Patient table as the ordering criteria to find the earliest entry. 4. The result should focus solely on retrieving the patient ID. 5. Lastly, I will use ORDER BY `First Date` and limit the result to 1 to ensure it's the first instance of an abnormal test result. Hence, the final SQL query combines these insights for a clear and precise selection.",
