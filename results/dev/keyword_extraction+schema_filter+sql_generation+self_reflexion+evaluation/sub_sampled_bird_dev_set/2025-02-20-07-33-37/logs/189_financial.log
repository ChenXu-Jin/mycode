This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. **Group the clients by account_id:** Use a GROUP BY clause on T1.account_id to aggregate the data. 2. **Calculate the average salary:** Use the AVG function on the salary field for each gender group of clients. 3. **Determine age:** First, convert the birth_date field to calculate the age of the clients, or use the birth_date directly in the WHERE clause to filter for the oldest clients. 4. **Filter for female clients:** Ensure you still filter for female clients. 5. **Use a subquery or Common Table Expression (CTE):** Construct a subquery or CTE to find the maximum birth_date (indicating the oldest) and join it with the main query to pull account numbers. 6. **Find the lowest average salary:** After calculating average salaries, order by average salary and limit the results to the lowest one. Here's a sample modification: 

```sql
WITH FemaleClients AS (
    SELECT T1.account_id, AVG(T2.salary) AS avg_salary, MAX(T3.birth_date) AS oldest_birth_date
    FROM account T1 
    JOIN disp T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
    JOIN client T3 ON T2.client_id = T3.client_id 
    WHERE T3.gender = 'F' 
    GROUP BY T1.account_id
)
SELECT account_id 
FROM FemaleClients 
WHERE oldest_birth_date = (SELECT MAX(oldest_birth_date) FROM FemaleClients) 
ORDER BY avg_salary ASC 
LIMIT 1;```

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.account_id FROM account T1 JOIN disp T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id JOIN client T3 ON T2.client_id = T3.client_id JOIN district T4 ON T3.district_id = T4.district_id WHERE T3.gender = 'F' ORDER BY T4.A11 ASC, T3.birth_date ASC LIMIT 1;"]

Question: 
Name the account numbers of female clients who are oldest and have lowest average salary? 

Hint:
Female refers to 'F' in the gender; A11 contains information about average salary

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Separate the conditions for determining the oldest clients and those with the lowest average salary by first identifying the oldest birth date for female clients in one part of the CTE. 2. In a second step, calculate the average salary for only those clients who match the oldest birth date. 3. Combine these results to make sure you only retrieve account numbers that meet both conditions. The revised query structure could look like this:

WITH OldestFemaleClients AS ( 
    SELECT MAX(T3.birth_date) AS oldest_birth_date 
    FROM client T3 
    WHERE T3.gender = 'F' 
), 

FemaleClients AS ( 
    SELECT T1.account_id, AVG(T4.A11) AS avg_salary 
    FROM account T1 
    JOIN disp T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
    JOIN client T3 ON T2.client_id = T3.client_id 
    JOIN district T4 ON T3.district_id = T4.district_id 
    WHERE T3.gender = 'F' AND T3.birth_date IN (SELECT oldest_birth_date FROM OldestFemaleClients) 
    GROUP BY T1.account_id 
) 

SELECT account_id 
FROM FemaleClients 
ORDER BY avg_salary ASC 
LIMIT 1;

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.account_id FROM account T1 JOIN disp T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id JOIN client T3 ON T2.client_id = T3.client_id JOIN district T4 ON T3.district_id = T4.district_id WHERE T3.gender = 'F' ORDER BY T4.A11 ASC, T3.birth_date ASC LIMIT 1;", "WITH FemaleClients AS ( SELECT T1.account_id, AVG(T4.A11) AS avg_salary, MAX(T3.birth_date) AS oldest_birth_date FROM account T1 JOIN disp T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id JOIN client T3 ON T2.client_id = T3.client_id JOIN district T4 ON T3.district_id = T4.district_id WHERE T3.gender = 'F' GROUP BY T1.account_id ) SELECT account_id FROM FemaleClients WHERE oldest_birth_date = (SELECT MIN(oldest_birth_date) FROM FemaleClients) ORDER BY avg_salary ASC LIMIT 1;"]

Question: 
Name the account numbers of female clients who are oldest and have lowest average salary? 

Hint:
Female refers to 'F' in the gender; A11 contains information about average salary

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Modify the 'OldestFemaleClients' CTE to retrieve all female clients who have the oldest birth date instead of just selecting the minimum birth date. You can achieve this by utilizing a subquery that selects all clients that match the minimum birth date found. 2. In the 'FemaleClients' CTE, filter by this set of clients, ensuring you are averaging salaries for all accounts corresponding to the oldest female clients. 3. Finally, ensure the final selection retrieves the account numbers of all those clients with the lowest average salary, rather than limiting the result to one account number. Here's a revised query structure:  

WITH OldestFemaleClients AS (  
    SELECT T3.client_id  
    FROM client T3  
    WHERE T3.gender = 'F' AND T3.birth_date = (SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F')  
), FemaleClients AS (  
    SELECT T1.account_id, AVG(T4.A11) AS avg_salary  
    FROM account T1  
    JOIN disp T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id  
    JOIN OldestFemaleClients OFC ON T2.client_id = OFC.client_id  
    JOIN district T4 ON OFC.client_id = T3.client_id  
    GROUP BY T1.account_id  
)  
SELECT account_id  
FROM FemaleClients  
WHERE avg_salary = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM FemaleClients);

Question: 
Name the account numbers of female clients who are oldest and have lowest average salary? 

Hint:
Female refers to 'F' in the gender; A11 contains information about average salary

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To answer the question, I need to find account numbers of female clients who are the oldest and have the lowest average salary. I will break this down into several steps. First, I'll identify the oldest female clients by finding the minimum birth date among female clients (\u2018F\u2019). I will create a Common Table Expression (CTE) called 'OldestFemaleClients' to fetch their client IDs. Then, I'll calculate the average salary for accounts associated with these oldest clients in another CTE called 'FemaleClients'. This will involve joining the 'account', 'disp', 'client', and 'district' tables. Lastly, I will select account numbers from 'FemaleClients' that correspond with the lowest average salary using an ORDER BY clause to sort the average salary in ascending order. Here's how I'll structure the query overall: use subqueries/CTEs as needed, ensure proper joins, and apply filtering to only include necessary columns, leveraging the fact that we need to return account numbers only. By following these considerations, I can ensure that the generated SQL accurately reflects the question's requirements.",
