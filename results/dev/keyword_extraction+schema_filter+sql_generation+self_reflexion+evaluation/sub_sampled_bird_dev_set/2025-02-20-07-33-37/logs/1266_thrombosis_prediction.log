Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Which is the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level? Please list his or her date of birth.

SQL Query:
SELECT MAX(P.Birthday) FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-');

Database Content:
{'Examination': ['ID', 'Examination Date', 'aCL IgG', 'aCL IgM', 'ANA', 'ANA Pattern', 'aCL IgA', 'Diagnosis', 'KCT', 'RVVT', 'LAC', 'Symptoms', 'Thrombosis'], 'Patient': ['ID', 'SEX', 'Birthday', 'Description', 'First Date', 'Admission', 'Diagnosis'], 'Laboratory': ['ID', 'Date', 'GOT', 'GPT', 'LDH', 'ALP', 'TP', 'ALB', 'UA', 'UN', 'CRE', 'T-BIL', 'T-CHO', 'TG', 'CPK', 'GLU', 'WBC', 'RBC', 'HGB', 'HCT', 'PLT', 'PT', 'APTT', 'FG', 'PIC', 'TAT', 'TAT2', 'U-PRO', 'IGG', 'IGA', 'IGM', 'CRP', 'RA', 'RF', 'C3', 'C4', 'RNP', 'SM', 'SC170', 'SSA', 'SSB', 'CENTROMEA', 'DNA', 'DNA-II']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so it aligns with the intent of identifying the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level, you should follow these steps: 1. Instead of using 'MAX(P.Birthday)' to find the latest date, change it to order the results based on the birthday in descending order to get the youngest patient at the top of the result set. 2. Select the patient's ID and Birthday in the SELECT clause to explicitly return the information of the youngest patient. 3. Limit the results to just the top record using 'LIMIT 1' to ensure you only get the youngest patient. The corrected SQL query should look like this:  'SELECT P.ID, P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY P.Birthday DESC LIMIT 1'. This will return the correct date of birth for the youngest patient with an abnormal RNP level.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT MAX(P.Birthday) FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-');"]

Question: 
Which is the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level? Please list his or her date of birth. 

Hint:
youngest patient refers to MAX(Birthday); abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level refers to RNP NOT IN('-', '+-'); date of birth refers to Birthday;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Which is the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level? Please list his or her date of birth.

SQL Query:
SELECT P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY P.Birthday DESC LIMIT 1;

Database Content:
{'Examination': ['ID', 'Examination Date', 'aCL IgG', 'aCL IgM', 'ANA', 'ANA Pattern', 'aCL IgA', 'Diagnosis', 'KCT', 'RVVT', 'LAC', 'Symptoms', 'Thrombosis'], 'Patient': ['ID', 'SEX', 'Birthday', 'Description', 'First Date', 'Admission', 'Diagnosis'], 'Laboratory': ['ID', 'Date', 'GOT', 'GPT', 'LDH', 'ALP', 'TP', 'ALB', 'UA', 'UN', 'CRE', 'T-BIL', 'T-CHO', 'TG', 'CPK', 'GLU', 'WBC', 'RBC', 'HGB', 'HCT', 'PLT', 'PT', 'APTT', 'FG', 'PIC', 'TAT', 'TAT2', 'U-PRO', 'IGG', 'IGA', 'IGM', 'CRP', 'RA', 'RF', 'C3', 'C4', 'RNP', 'SM', 'SC170', 'SSA', 'SSB', 'CENTROMEA', 'DNA', 'DNA-II']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent of finding the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level, you should change the way the query orders the results. Specifically, instead of ordering by 'P.Birthday' in descending order, you should order it in ascending order so that the youngest patient's birthday appears first. Additionally, since we are interested in only one patient, ensure to keep the 'LIMIT 1'. The revised SQL query should look like this: 'SELECT P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY P.Birthday ASC LIMIT 1;'. This will correctly select the patient with the most recent (youngest) birthday among those with abnormal RNP levels.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT MAX(P.Birthday) FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-');", "SELECT P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY P.Birthday DESC LIMIT 1;"]

Question: 
Which is the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level? Please list his or her date of birth. 

Hint:
youngest patient refers to MAX(Birthday); abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level refers to RNP NOT IN('-', '+-'); date of birth refers to Birthday;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent of finding the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein (RNP) level, follow these actionable steps: 
1. Review the criteria for 'abnormal' anti-ribonuclear protein levels and ensure the SQL query properly reflects those criteria. For instance, if abnormal levels are defined explicitly by certain numerical thresholds or other specific values, update the WHERE clause to include those conditions. 
2. Replace the current condition in the WHERE clause with a direct definition of abnormal RNP levels. For example: use `WHERE L.RNP < threshold_low OR L.RNP > threshold_high` where `threshold_low` and `threshold_high` are the correct values defining abnormality. 
3. After correcting the WHERE clause, maintain the ORDER BY clause to ensure that the youngest patient based on their date of birth is selected. 
4. Ensure that `LIMIT 1` remains as it will correctly limit the results to the youngest patient only. 

Revised SQL Example:
```sql
SELECT P.Birthday 
FROM Patient P 
JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID 
WHERE L.RNP < threshold_low OR L.RNP > threshold_high 
ORDER BY P.Birthday DESC 
LIMIT 1;
``` 
5. Finally, test the modified query to ensure it returns the correct patient by running sample data to validate results against the known definitions of abnormal RNP levels.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT MAX(P.Birthday) FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-');", "SELECT P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY P.Birthday DESC LIMIT 1;", "SELECT P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY P.Birthday ASC LIMIT 1;"]

Question: 
Which is the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level? Please list his or her date of birth. 

Hint:
youngest patient refers to MAX(Birthday); abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level refers to RNP NOT IN('-', '+-'); date of birth refers to Birthday;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To determine the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein (RNP) level, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the definition of 'youngest', which is related to the maximum date of birth (Birthday). 2. Define 'abnormal' RNP levels based on the criteria provided in the task, specifically that RNP should not be in ('-', '+-'). 3. Join the Patient table with the Laboratory table on the common ID field to access both patient information and laboratory results. 4. Utilize the ORDER BY clause to sort the results by the Birthday in descending order, making sure the most recent (youngest) date is at the top. 5. Finally, I will limit the results to just one entry using LIMIT 1 to get the youngest patient only. Hence, the final SQL query will reflect these criteria.",
