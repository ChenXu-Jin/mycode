This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, you should take the following steps: 1. Ensure that you are filtering out any card with multiple faces correctly. Instead of just checking for 'side IS NULL', double-check if there are other columns that indicate multi-faced cards, like a 'multiFace' column or similar. 2. Use 'ORDER BY convertedManaCost DESC' to sort the results by the maximum converted mana cost, but also ensure that you account for ties. To do this, select both 'artist' and 'convertedManaCost', and use a subquery to find the maximum converted mana cost. 3. Use a subquery to select the artist(s) for the cards that match the highest converted mana cost. Therefore, the modified SQL query could look like this:  

SELECT artist FROM cards WHERE convertedManaCost = (SELECT MAX(convertedManaCost) FROM cards WHERE side IS NULL) AND side IS NULL;

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT artist FROM cards WHERE side IS NULL ORDER BY convertedManaCost DESC LIMIT 1;']

Question: 
Among the cards that doesn't have multiple faces on the same card, who is the illustrator of the card art that has the highest cost of converted mana? 

Hint:
doesn't have multiple faces refers to side IS NULL; illustrator refers to artist

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

The absence of multiple faces is indicated by the 'side IS NULL' condition. To satisfy the requirement of finding the card with the highest converted mana cost, I can utilize a subquery to first determine this maximum value. I will then filter the main query to select the artist from the cards table where the converted mana cost matches this maximum value and ensure that the side column is NULL to exclude multi-faced cards.

Input Data

Question:
Among the cards that doesn't have multiple faces on the same card, who is the illustrator of the card art that has the highest cost of converted mana?

SQL Query:
SELECT artist FROM cards WHERE convertedManaCost = (SELECT MAX(convertedManaCost) FROM cards WHERE side IS NULL) AND side IS NULL;

Database Content:
{'cards': ['id', 'artist', 'asciiName', 'availability', 'borderColor', 'cardKingdomFoilId', 'cardKingdomId', 'colorIdentity', 'colorIndicator', 'colors', 'convertedManaCost', 'duelDeck', 'edhrecRank', 'faceConvertedManaCost', 'faceName', 'flavorName', 'flavorText', 'frameEffects', 'frameVersion', 'hand', 'hasAlternativeDeckLimit', 'hasContentWarning', 'hasFoil', 'hasNonFoil', 'isAlternative', 'isFullArt', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isOversized', 'isPromo', 'isReprint', 'isReserved', 'isStarter', 'isStorySpotlight', 'isTextless', 'isTimeshifted', 'keywords', 'layout', 'leadershipSkills', 'life', 'loyalty', 'manaCost', 'mcmId', 'mcmMetaId', 'mtgArenaId', 'mtgjsonV4Id', 'mtgoFoilId', 'mtgoId', 'multiverseId', 'name', 'number', 'originalReleaseDate', 'originalText', 'originalType', 'otherFaceIds', 'power', 'printings', 'promoTypes', 'purchaseUrls', 'rarity', 'scryfallId', 'scryfallIllustrationId', 'scryfallOracleId', 'setCode', 'side', 'subtypes', 'supertypes', 'tcgplayerProductId', 'text', 'toughness', 'type', 'types', 'uuid', 'variations', 'watermark'], 'foreign_data': ['id', 'flavorText', 'language', 'multiverseid', 'name', 'text', 'type', 'uuid'], 'legalities': ['id', 'format', 'status', 'uuid'], 'sets': ['id', 'baseSetSize', 'block', 'booster', 'code', 'isFoilOnly', 'isForeignOnly', 'isNonFoilOnly', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isPartialPreview', 'keyruneCode', 'mcmId', 'mcmIdExtras', 'mcmName', 'mtgoCode', 'name', 'parentCode', 'releaseDate', 'tcgplayerGroupId', 'totalSetSize', 'type'], 'set_translations': ['id', 'language', 'setCode', 'translation'], 'rulings': ['id', 'date', 'text', 'uuid']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.
