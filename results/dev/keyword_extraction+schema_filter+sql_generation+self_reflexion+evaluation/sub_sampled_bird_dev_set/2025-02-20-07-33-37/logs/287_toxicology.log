You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Among all chemical compounds that contain molecule TR047, identify the percent that form a double-bond. 

Hint:
TR047 is the molecule id; double bond refers to bond_type = ' = '; percentage = DIVIDE(SUM(bond_type = ' = '), COUNT(all bond_id)) as percent where molecule_id = 'TR047'

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)

);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. **Clarify Bond Type**: First, review the database schema to confirm the representation of double bonds. Ensure that 'bond_type' accurately captures double bonds in the database. If 'bond_type' is not consistently defined, adjust the condition accordingly (e.g., if double bonds are identified as 'double' or other symbols, update the condition to match).

2. **Correct Bond Type Condition**: If double bonds are indeed represented differently than ' = ', modify the SQL query to reflect the correct bond type condition, such as `SUM(bond_type = 'double')` or whatever the correct representation may be.

3. **Ensure Non-Null Counts**: Add a filter in the `WHERE` clause to ensure that you only count valid bonds. If `bond_id` can be null or there are any irrelevant bonds, refine your query to filter those out.

4. **Refine the Calculation**: To avoid division by zero, you might want to add a `CASE` statement to handle scenarios where there might be no bonds for the specified molecule.

5. **Complete Query Example**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
       (100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN bond_type = 'desired_double_bond_representation' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / NULLIF(COUNT(bond_id), 0)) AS percent 
   FROM bond 
   WHERE molecule_id = 'TR047';
   ```
   Use 'desired_double_bond_representation' to represent the correct condition found in your database schema.

6. **Testing**: After modifying the SQL query, run it against the database to validate the results and ensure it returns the expected percentage of double bonds for the given molecule.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT (100.0 * SUM(bond_type = ' = ') / COUNT(bond_id)) AS percent FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR047';"]

Question:

Hint:
TR047 is the molecule id; double bond refers to bond_type = ' = '; percentage = DIVIDE(SUM(bond_type = ' = '), COUNT(all bond_id)) as percent where molecule_id = 'TR047'

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.

3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Verify the representation of double bonds in the 'bond_type' column. If double bonds are indicated by a different string (such as 'double'), replace ' = ' in the SUM condition with the correct representation. Update the query to: 'SUM(bond_type = 'double')'. 2. Ensure that the conditions in the WHERE clause exclusively reference records containing the molecule TR047. 3. Optionally, confirm that the total bond count calculates only when bonds exist for the molecule TR047 to avoid misinterpretation of the result, ensuring that the NULLIF condition is relevant. Rewritten query: 'SELECT (100.0 * SUM(bond_type = 'double') / NULLIF(COUNT(bond_id), 0)) AS percent FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR047';'. Make these changes to ensure that the query accurately captures the intended percentage of double bonds for the specified molecule.

Question: 
Among all chemical compounds that contain molecule TR047, identify the percent that form a double-bond. 

Hint:
TR047 is the molecule id; double bond refers to bond_type = ' = '; percentage = DIVIDE(SUM(bond_type = ' = '), COUNT(all bond_id)) as percent where molecule_id = 'TR047'

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To formulate the SQL query that calculates the percentage of double bonds for molecule TR047, the first step is to identify the structure of the database and the relevant tables involved. The question specifically focuses on the 'bond' table since it contains information about the bond type. According to the provided schema and hint, the 'bond_type' column will indicate double bonds with the value ' = '. Therefore, my query needs to count these double bonds, as well as the total number of bonds associated with the molecule TR047. To calculate the percentage, I will utilize the formula: (SUM of double bonds / Count of all bonds) * 100. Furthermore, I will need to ensure that this calculation handles cases where there might be no bonds by using the NULLIF function to avoid division by zero errors. According to Long-Term Memory principle 1, I should employ ORDER BY + LIMIT instead of using MAX/MIN for other queries, yet for this percentage calculation, that principle doesn't apply. I will also ensure to filter specifically for molecule_id 'TR047'. Therefore, the SQL query will look like this: SELECT (100.0 * SUM(bond_type = ' = ') / NULLIF(COUNT(bond_id), 0)) AS percent FROM bond WHERE molecule_id = 'TR047'; This captures the required result exactly, checking for double bonds and avoiding division by zero errors.",
