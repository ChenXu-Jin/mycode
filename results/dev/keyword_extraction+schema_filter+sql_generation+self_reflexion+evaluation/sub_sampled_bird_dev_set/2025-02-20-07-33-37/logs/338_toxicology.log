You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (

);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure the SQL query meets the requirements of identifying the atom ID of double bonded carbon in the TR012 molecule, you need to adjust the condition related to bond type. Here are the specific steps to modify the SQL query:

1. Change the bond type condition to correctly identify double bonds. Depending on the specific convention used in your database, you may want to replace `T2.bond_type = ' = '` with `T2.bond_type = 'double'` or `T2.bond_type = '=='`, which are common representations for double bonds.

2. Ensure the join conditions are correctly structured to imply that the carbon atoms are connected to other atoms via double bonds. The current join may suggest an incorrect association; you may want to ensure that your joins correctly reflect the relationships within the `bond` and `atom` tables.

3. Consider adding additional filtering conditions if required, to ensure you are capturing only the relevant carbon atoms that are part of double bonds.

The modified query could look like this:

```sql
SELECT T1.atom_id 
FROM atom AS T1 
JOIN bond AS T2 ON T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id_1 OR T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id_2 
JOIN molecule AS T3 ON T1.molecule_id = T3.molecule_id 
WHERE T3.molecule_id = 'TR012' AND T1.element = 'C' AND T2.bond_type = 'double';
```

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.atom_id FROM atom AS T1 JOIN bond AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id JOIN molecule AS T3 ON T2.molecule_id = T3.molecule_id WHERE T3.molecule_id = 'TR012' AND T1.element = 'c' AND T2.bond_type = ' = ';"]

Question: 
What is the atom ID of double bonded carbon in TR012 molecule? 

Hint:
carbon refers to element = 'c'; double bond refers to bond_type = ' = ';

You may want to add an additional condition to the WHERE clause, such as checking if the other connected atom is also carbon. 3. Simplify the JOIN conditions for clarity. Double-check the relationships among the tables to ensure you're only getting connected carbon atoms participating in double bonds. 4. After making these changes, test the query to confirm it retrieves the correct atom ID(s) for carbon atoms forming double bonds in the specified molecule.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To answer the question about the atom ID of double bonded carbon in the molecule 'TR012', I'll follow these steps: First, I'll identify the relevant tables involved. The 'atom' table contains the information about the elements. The 'bond' table stores the bond types, and the 'connected' table specifies which atoms are connected by those bonds. Since we are looking specifically for carbon atoms that participate in double bonds (as indicated by the bond_type), I need to join these tables appropriately. The major checkpoints are: 1. Select atom IDs from the 'atom' table where the element is Carbon (element = 'C') and is part of a double bond (bond_type = 'double'). 2. I will filter by the molecule ID 'TR012' to narrow down the query scope. 3. Using JOINs, I will connect the 'atom', 'bond', and 'connected' tables to find pairs where a carbon atom is double bonded to another carbon atom. 4. Finally, I will leverage ORDER BY and LIMIT for potentially better performance over the MIN/MAX functions, if applicable. 5. I ensure all conditions align with the question's strict requirements, especially focusing on the required relationships between carbon atoms and double bonds. After considering these points, I will structure the SQL query accordingly to ensure it retrieves the correct atom IDs only.",

Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
What is the atom ID of double bonded carbon in TR012 molecule?

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.atom_id FROM atom AS T1 JOIN connected AS T2 ON T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id OR T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id2 JOIN bond AS T3 ON T2.bond_id = T3.bond_id JOIN molecule AS T4 ON T1.molecule_id = T4.molecule_id WHERE T4.molecule_id = 'TR012' AND T1.element = 'C' AND T3.bond_type = 'double';

Database Content:
{'atom': ['atom_id', 'molecule_id', 'element'], 'bond': ['bond_id', 'molecule_id', 'bond_type', 'bondtype'], 'connected': ['atom_id', 'atom_id2', 'bond_id'], 'molecule': ['molecule_id', 'label']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the atom ID of a double-bonded carbon in a specific molecule (TR012). The SQL query attempts to retrieve atom IDs by joining four tables: atom, connected, bond, and molecule. The filtering is based on the molecule ID being 'TR012', the element being carbon ('C'), and the bond type being 'double'. This aligns well with the intent of the question. Moreover, it correctly identifies double-bonded carbon atoms by ensuring the bond type filter in the WHERE clause. Therefore, the query logically corresponds to the question. There are no missing components or inaccuracies in the SQL that would lead to an invalid answer. The execution will yield the desired atom IDs, assuming the underlying data aligns with the query logic, which we have no reason to doubt based on the provided database schema.",
