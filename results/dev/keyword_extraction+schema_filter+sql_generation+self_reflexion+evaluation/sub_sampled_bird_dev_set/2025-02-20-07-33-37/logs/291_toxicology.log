You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Additionally, there's no condition in the SQL query to define what the appropriate label for carcinogenic compounds would be. Therefore, the query likely does not correctly address the question if '+' is not explicitly defined as carcinogenic. Thus, I conclude that the provided SQL query does not satisfy the question's requirements effectively.",

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify the meaning of the `label` field in the `molecule` table. Assess if there is documentation or schema definition that clarifies what different labels indicate, specifically if '+' indicates carcinogenic compounds. 

2. If the definition for carcinogenic compounds exists, update the SQL query to use the appropriate label or labels that accurately represent carcinogenicity. For example, if carcinogenic compounds are labeled with 'C' or any other specific character, change the WHERE clause to reflect that. 

3. If multiple labels can indicate carcinogenicity, use the IN operator to count all relevant labels, such as: 
   ```sql 
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule AS T1 WHERE T1.label IN ('C', 'X'); 
   ``` 

4. If additional filtering is needed (for instance, excluding non-chemical records), ensure to add those conditions to the WHERE clause as well. 

5. Finally, rerun the SQL query to confirm that it now provides the correct count of carcinogenic compounds as per the question.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule AS T1 WHERE T1.label = '+'", "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule AS T1 WHERE T1.label = '+';", "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule AS T1 WHERE T1.label = '+';"]

Question: 
How many chemical compounds in the database are identified as carcinogenic. 

Hint:
label = '+' mean molecules are carcinogenic;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
