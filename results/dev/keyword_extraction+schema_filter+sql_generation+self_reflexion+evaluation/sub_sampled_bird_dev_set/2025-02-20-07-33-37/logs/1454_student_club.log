This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to accurately reflect the percentage of the cost for game events, consider the following steps: 1. Replace 'COUNT(T1.event_id)' with 'COUNT(DISTINCT T2.link_to_budget)' to count only the unique budgets associated with the expenses for game events, ensuring that you only count events that have associated costs. 2. Add handling for cases where there are no corresponding expenses to avoid potential division by zero errors. This can be done using a CASE statement or a COALESCE function to provide a default denominator when there are no expenses. 3. Lastly, ensure that the structure of the joins correctly reflects the relationships among the tables so that the sums and counts return the correct values. The revised SQL query could look like this: SELECT (SUM(T2.cost) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT T2.link_to_budget), 0)) * 100 AS percentage FROM event AS T1 JOIN budget AS T3 ON T1.event_id = T3.link_to_event JOIN expense AS T2 ON T2.link_to_budget = T3.budget_id WHERE T1.type = 'Game' AND T2.cost IS NOT NULL;

However, the SQL query computes the percentage by dividing the total cost by the count of event IDs rather than the total budget amount or total number of game-specific operations. Thus, while it aims to compute a percentage, it could be ambiguous if we are not explicitly clear about what the denominator should represent within the context of the question. Therefore, while the SQL appears logically constructed, it incorrectly interprets the percentage calculation based on event count instead of what might be the total event-related budget or total expenses, leading to an invalid outcome. Overall, it fails to afford necessary clarity in denominating the correct total for percentage calculation as prescribed by the question.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, which is to calculate the percentage of the cost for game events, consider the following actionable steps: 

1. **Clarify the Denominator**: Replace the count of event IDs (`COUNT(T1.event_id)`) with a suitable measure that reflects the total budget or total amount allocated for game events. This may involve summing up the costs or total budget from the 'budget' table relevant to game events. A possible correct denominator could be the total budget amount for the 'Game' events. This could be computed as: 
   ```
   SUM(T3.amount) 
   ```
   where `T3.amount` references the total budget amount allocated.

2. **Adjusting the SQL Calculation**: Update the SQL calculation to:  
   ```sql
   SELECT (SUM(T2.cost) / NULLIF(SUM(T3.amount), 0)) * 100 AS percentage  
   FROM event AS T1  
   JOIN budget AS T3 ON T1.event_id = T3.link_to_event  
   JOIN expense AS T2 ON T2.link_to_budget = T3.budget_id  
   WHERE T1.type = 'Game' AND T2.cost IS NOT NULL;
   ```
   This ensures that you are calculating the percentage of total costs against the total budget for game events.

3. **Verify Join Conditions**: Ensure that the join conditions accurately reflect the relationships between events, budgets, and expenses. Check that the `link_to_event` and `link_to_budget` fields correctly link the tables.

4. **Testing and Validation**: After implementing these changes, execute the modified query and validate the results against expected outcomes to ensure accuracy.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT (SUM(T2.cost) / COUNT(T1.event_id)) * 100 AS percentage FROM event AS T1 JOIN budget AS T3 ON T1.event_id = T3.link_to_event JOIN expense AS T2 ON T2.link_to_budget = T3.budget_id WHERE T1.type = 'Game' AND T2.cost IS NOT NULL;", "SELECT (SUM(T2.cost) / NULLIF(COUNT(T1.event_id), 0)) * 100 AS percentage FROM event AS T1 JOIN budget AS T3 ON T1.event_id = T3.link_to_event JOIN expense AS T2 ON T2.link_to_budget = T3.budget_id WHERE T1.type = 'Game' AND T2.cost IS NOT NULL;"]

Question: 
What is the percentage of the cost for the game events? 

Hint:
game events refers to type = 'Game'; percentage = DIVIDE( SUM(cost), COUNT(event_id)) * 100

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To calculate the percentage of the cost for game events, I need to clarify the formula as per the question. The question states to divide the SUM of costs for game events by the COUNT of event IDs, then multiply by 100. However, in the case of percentages, the denominator should typically represent the total budget allocated for game events, not just a count of IDs. Hence, I will compute the SUM of costs from the 'expense' table linked to 'budget' and 'event' that are classified as 'Game'. The structure of the query involves joining the 'event', 'budget', and 'expense' tables to ensure I gather all necessary data. I will also filter costs that are not NULL and focus only on the game events (type = 'Game'). I will use NULLIF to ensure that division by zero does not occur. Consequently, I substitute COUNT(T1.event_id) with SUM(T3.amount) to reflect the total budget amount for game events. This means the final calculation becomes: (SUM(T2.cost) / NULLIF(SUM(T3.amount), 0)) * 100, which permits the calculation of the percentage of the total costs against the total budget.",
