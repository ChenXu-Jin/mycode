This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify the color IDs: First, confirm that 'eye_colour_id = 7' corresponds to blue eyes and 'hair_colour_id = 9' corresponds to brown hair in the relevant lookup table or dataset. If the IDs do not match the required colors, replace them with the correct IDs. 2. Update the SQL query: If the IDs are incorrect, modify the SQL query to use the correct IDs that specifically represent blue eyes and brown hair. For example, if you find that 'eye_colour_id = 2' is blue and 'hair_colour_id = 4' is brown, change the SQL to: SELECT superhero_name FROM superhero WHERE eye_colour_id = 2 AND hair_colour_id = 4; 3. Test the query: After making changes, run the modified query to ensure it returns the expected set of superheroes with blue eyes and brown hair. 4. Document the ID mappings: For future queries, maintain documentation of the ID mappings for eye and hair colors to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT superhero_name FROM superhero WHERE eye_colour_id = 7 AND hair_colour_id = 9;']

Question: 
Which superheroes have blue eyes with brown hair? 

Hint:
