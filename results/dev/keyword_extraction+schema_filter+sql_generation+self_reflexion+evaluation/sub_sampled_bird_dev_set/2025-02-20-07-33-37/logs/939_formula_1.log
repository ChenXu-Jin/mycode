This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
How many drivers from the USA participated in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?

SQL Query:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT D.driverId) FROM races R JOIN results Res ON R.raceId = Res.raceId JOIN drivers D ON Res.driverId = D.driverId WHERE R.year = 2008 AND R.name = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND D.nationality = 'American';

Database Content:
{'circuits': ['circuitId', 'circuitRef', 'name', 'location', 'country', 'lat', 'lng', 'alt', 'url'], 'constructors': ['constructorId', 'constructorRef', 'name', 'nationality', 'url'], 'drivers': ['driverId', 'driverRef', 'number', 'code', 'forename', 'surname', 'dob', 'nationality', 'url'], 'seasons': ['year', 'url'], 'races': ['raceId', 'year', 'round', 'circuitId', 'name', 'date', 'time', 'url'], 'constructorResults': ['constructorResultsId', 'raceId', 'constructorId', 'points', 'status'], 'constructorStandings': ['constructorStandingsId', 'raceId', 'constructorId', 'points', 'position', 'positionText', 'wins'], 'driverStandings': ['driverStandingsId', 'raceId', 'driverId', 'points', 'position', 'positionText', 'wins'], 'lapTimes': ['raceId', 'driverId', 'lap', 'position', 'time', 'milliseconds'], 'pitStops': ['raceId', 'driverId', 'stop', 'lap', 'time', 'duration', 'milliseconds'], 'qualifying': ['qualifyId', 'raceId', 'driverId', 'constructorId', 'number', 'position', 'q1', 'q2', 'q3'], 'status': ['statusId', 'status'], 'results': ['resultId', 'raceId', 'driverId', 'constructorId', 'number', 'grid', 'position', 'positionText', 'positionOrder', 'points', 'laps', 'time', 'milliseconds', 'fastestLap', 'rank', 'fastestLapTime', 'fastestLapSpeed', 'statusId']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify the Nationality Value: Check the 'drivers' table to confirm how nationality is recorded for USA drivers. If it is stored as 'USA', modify the WHERE clause from 'D.nationality = 'American'' to 'D.nationality = 'USA''. 2. Ensure Correct Race Name: Confirm that 'Australian Grand Prix' is the exact name used in the 'races' table for the 2008 race; otherwise, update it accordingly. 3. Test the Query: After making these adjustments, execute the SQL query again to see if it returns a non-zero count, confirming the correctness of the nationality filter and race name.

Input Data

Question:
How many drivers from the USA participated in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?

SQL Query:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT D.driverId) FROM races R JOIN results Res ON R.raceId = Res.raceId JOIN drivers D ON Res.driverId = D.driverId WHERE R.year = 2008 AND R.name = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND D.nationality = 'USA';

Database Content:
{'circuits': ['circuitId', 'circuitRef', 'name', 'location', 'country', 'lat', 'lng', 'alt', 'url'], 'constructors': ['constructorId', 'constructorRef', 'name', 'nationality', 'url'], 'drivers': ['driverId', 'driverRef', 'number', 'code', 'forename', 'surname', 'dob', 'nationality', 'url'], 'seasons': ['year', 'url'], 'races': ['raceId', 'year', 'round', 'circuitId', 'name', 'date', 'time', 'url'], 'constructorResults': ['constructorResultsId', 'raceId', 'constructorId', 'points', 'status'], 'constructorStandings': ['constructorStandingsId', 'raceId', 'constructorId', 'points', 'position', 'positionText', 'wins'], 'driverStandings': ['driverStandingsId', 'raceId', 'driverId', 'points', 'position', 'positionText', 'wins'], 'lapTimes': ['raceId', 'driverId', 'lap', 'position', 'time', 'milliseconds'], 'pitStops': ['raceId', 'driverId', 'stop', 'lap', 'time', 'duration', 'milliseconds'], 'qualifying': ['qualifyId', 'raceId', 'driverId', 'constructorId', 'number', 'position', 'q1', 'q2', 'q3'], 'status': ['statusId', 'status'], 'results': ['resultId', 'raceId', 'driverId', 'constructorId', 'number', 'grid', 'position', 'positionText', 'positionOrder', 'points', 'laps', 'time', 'milliseconds', 'fastestLap', 'rank', 'fastestLapTime', 'fastestLapSpeed', 'statusId']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks how many drivers from the USA participated in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix. The SQL query seems to correctly use the joins among `races`, `results`, and `drivers` tables to count distinct drivers. It also specifies that the year must be 2008 and the race name is 'Australian Grand Prix', with an additional filter that the driver's nationality should be 'USA'. This directly aligns with the query objective. Since it counts distinct drivers, any potential duplicates from the results table will not affect the outcome. Therefore, provided all necessary components are accounted for, the SQL query should yield a valid count of USA drivers who participated in that specific race in 2008. Thus, the SQL query appears to completely and accurately meet the requirements outlined in the question, leading to a conclusion that it is valid.",
    "judgment": "Valid"
