These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: List the top 10 players' names whose heights are above 180 in descending order of average heading accuracy.
Hint: height > 180; average heading accuracy = DIVIDE(SUM(heading_accuracy), COUNT(player_fifa_api_id));

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent of listing the top 10 players' names whose heights are above 180 in descending order of average heading accuracy, consider the following steps: \n1. Adjust the `SELECT` clause to include both `T1.player_name` and the average heading accuracy as a column, using the `AVG` function. You'll want to use an alias for the average heading accuracy for clarity. \n   Example: `SELECT T1.player_name, AVG(T2.heading_accuracy) AS avg_heading_accuracy`.\n\n2. Include `T1.player_name` in the `GROUP BY` clause, since every column in the `SELECT` that isn't aggregated must be included in `GROUP BY`. \n   Modify the `GROUP BY` to: `GROUP BY T1.player_name`.\n\n3. Ensure that the `WHERE` clause correctly filters players over 180 in height. This part of your query appears correct. \n\n4. Maintain the `ORDER BY` clause to sort by the new alias for the average heading accuracy. It should look like this: `ORDER BY avg_heading_accuracy DESC`.\n\n5. Finally, keep the `LIMIT 10` to return only the top 10 results.\n\nAfter making these adjustments, your updated SQL query should look like this:\n```sql\nSELECT T1.player_name, AVG(T2.heading_accuracy) AS avg_heading_accuracy \nFROM Player T1 \nJOIN Player_Attributes T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id \nWHERE T1.height > 180 \nGROUP BY T1.player_name \nORDER BY avg_heading_accuracy DESC \nLIMIT 10;\n```"

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent of listing the top 10 players' names whose heights are above 180 in descending order of average heading accuracy, consider the following steps: 
1. Adjust the `SELECT` clause to include both `T1.player_name` and the average heading accuracy as a column, using the `AVG` function. You'll want to use an alias for the average heading accuracy for clarity. 
   Example: `SELECT T1.player_name, AVG(T2.heading_accuracy) AS avg_heading_accuracy`.

2. Include `T1.player_name` in the `GROUP BY` clause, since every column in the `SELECT` that isn't aggregated must be included in `GROUP BY`. 
   Modify the `GROUP BY` to: `GROUP BY T1.player_name`.

3. Ensure that the `WHERE` clause correctly filters players over 180 in height. This part of your query appears correct. 

4. Maintain the `ORDER BY` clause to sort by the new alias for the average heading accuracy. It should look like this: `ORDER BY avg_heading_accuracy DESC`.

5. Finally, keep the `LIMIT 10` to return only the top 10 results.

After making these adjustments, your updated SQL query should look like this:
```sql
SELECT T1.player_name, AVG(T2.heading_accuracy) AS avg_heading_accuracy 
FROM Player T1 
JOIN Player_Attributes T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id 
WHERE T1.height > 180 
GROUP BY T1.player_name 
ORDER BY avg_heading_accuracy DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T1.player_name FROM Player T1 JOIN Player_Attributes T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T1.height > 180 GROUP BY T1.player_api_id ORDER BY AVG(T2.heading_accuracy) DESC LIMIT 10;']

Question: 
List the top 10 players' names whose heights are above 180 in descending order of average heading accuracy. 

Hint:
height > 180; average heading accuracy = DIVIDE(SUM(heading_accuracy), COUNT(player_fifa_api_id));

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

The SQL query selects player names from the Player table and averages heading accuracy from the Player_Attributes table, which is appropriate.
