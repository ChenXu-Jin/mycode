This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score. 

Hint:
If the parent id is not null, the post is the child post; the highest score refers to MAX(Score);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to accurately reflect the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Identify the child post with the highest score by utilizing a subquery or a CTE (Common Table Expression) to first select the maximum score from the posts (T1). 2. Once you have the maximum score, retrieve the child post corresponding to this score and ensure its ParentId is not null. 3. Use this child post's ParentId to join with the posts table again to get the OwnerDisplayName from the parent post (T2). The modified query could look like this: 

WITH MaxScorePost AS (
    SELECT * FROM posts
    WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY Score DESC
    LIMIT 1
)

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To address the question about the display name of the parent ID for the child post with the highest score, I need to follow several reasoning steps: 1. **Identify Child Posts**: Since the question specifies looking for child posts, I will only consider posts where the ParentId is not null. 2. **Find Maximum Score**: I need to find the post with the highest score among these child posts, which I can do using an ORDER BY clause and a LIMIT of 1. 3. **Get Parent Information**: Once I identify the child post with the highest score, I need to retrieve the display name of its parent post. For this, I will join the posts table back to itself using the ParentId. 4. **Construct the Query**: I will create a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first select the child post with the highest score and then join it with the posts table to extract the OwnerDisplayName of the parent post. This adheres to the guiding principles of SQL generation by ensuring only the necessary information is retrieved and correctly mapped. 5. **Final Structure**: The final SQL query needs to select the OwnerDisplayName based on the relationships established between the child and parent posts while organizing the data as per the mentioned logic.",

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score.

SQL Query:
WITH MaxScorePost AS (SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM MaxScorePost T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id;

Database Content:
{'badges': ['Id', 'UserId', 'Name', 'Date'], 'comments': ['Id', 'PostId', 'Score', 'Text', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postHistory': ['Id', 'PostHistoryTypeId', 'PostId', 'RevisionGUID', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'Text', 'Comment', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postLinks': ['Id', 'CreationDate', 'PostId', 'RelatedPostId', 'LinkTypeId'], 'posts': ['Id', 'PostTypeId', 'AcceptedAnswerId', 'CreaionDate', 'Score', 'ViewCount', 'Body', 'OwnerUserId', 'LasActivityDate', 'Title', 'Tags', 'AnswerCount', 'CommentCount', 'FavoriteCount', 'LastEditorUserId', 'LastEditDate', 'CommunityOwnedDate', 'ParentId', 'ClosedDate', 'OwnerDisplayName', 'LastEditorDisplayName'], 'tags': ['Id', 'TagName', 'Count', 'ExcerptPostId', 'WikiPostId'], 'users': ['Id', 'Reputation', 'CreationDate', 'DisplayName', 'LastAccessDate', 'WebsiteUrl', 'Location', 'AboutMe', 'Views', 'UpVotes', 'DownVotes', 'AccountId', 'Age', 'ProfileImageUrl'], 'votes': ['Id', 'PostId', 'VoteTypeId', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'BountyAmount']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the display name of the parent ID for the child post with the highest score. The SQL query uses a Common Table Expression (CTE) named MaxScorePost to identify the child post with the highest score by filtering for posts with a non-null ParentId and ordering by Score in descending order. It then selects the OwnerDisplayName from the parent post by joining the results of MaxScorePost with the posts table based on the ParentId being equal to the Id in posts. The query appears to be logically structured to accomplish the task described in the question. However, there is a misspelling in 'CreaionDate', but this does not affect the query's functionality for selecting display names. If I presume the database contains the correct data corresponding to valid posts, the expected output aligns with the requirements stated in the question. Therefore, I conclude that the SQL query correctly achieves the intent of the question.",
