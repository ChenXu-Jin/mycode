This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it accurately answers the question about counting male customers in North Bohemia with an average salary greater than 8000, follow these steps: 1. Verify the database schema to identify the correct columns for capturing individual salaries. Ensure that you locate the salary data for clients, which might reside in a different table. 2. If there is a table that includes individual salary records, you will need to include a JOIN statement to aggregate these salaries based on the client IDs. 3. Replace the filter condition 'D.A11 > 8000' with a proper aggregation calculation, such as using 'HAVING AVG(salary) > 8000' after joining the relevant salary data. 4. The modified SQL query could resemble the following structure:  
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.client_id)  
   FROM client C  
   JOIN district D ON C.district_id = D.district_id  
   JOIN salary_table S ON C.client_id = S.client_id  
   WHERE C.gender = 'M' AND D.A3 = 'North Bohemia'  
   GROUP BY C.client_id  
   HAVING AVG(S.salary) > 8000;  
  Make sure to adjust the table names and field names based on your actual database schema.

Short-Term Memory:

["SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.client_id) FROM client C JOIN district D ON C.district_id = D.district_id WHERE C.gender = 'M' AND D.A3 = 'North Bohemia' AND D.A11 > 8000;"]

Question: 
How many male customers who are living in North Bohemia have average salary greater than 8000? 

Hint:
Male means that gender = 'M'; A3 refers to region; A11 pertains to average salary.

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

I must first identify the relevant tables and columns from the provided schema. The client table holds information about customers, including their gender and district.

However, the average salary data is not directly stored in the given schema; it's implied that A11 in the district table serves as a proxy for average salary. The question specifies filtering on male customers (gender = 'M') and restricting results to those living in North Bohemia (A3 = 'North Bohemia').

Thus, I will set the filtering for average salary in the WHERE clause rather than using HAVING given I don't have details of salary records per client.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it accurately answers the question about male customers living in North Bohemia with an average salary greater than 8000, follow these actionable steps: 1. Identify the correct field that represents salary in the client table, rather than using D.A11, which appears to be related to district data. 2. Change the filter condition in the WHERE clause from D.A11 > 8000 to C.salary > 8000 (assuming 'salary' is the correct field name in the client table). 3. Ensure that there is no misalignment in the data types; if 'salary' is stored as a string, convert it to a numeric type for comparison. Thus, the modified query may look like this: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.client_id) FROM client C JOIN district D ON C.district_id = D.district_id WHERE C.gender = 'M' AND D.A3 = 'North Bohemia' AND C.salary > 8000; This ensures you are counting distinct male clients living in the specified district who meet the salary requirement.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.client_id) FROM client C JOIN district D ON C.district_id = D.district_id WHERE C.gender = 'M' AND D.A3 = 'North Bohemia' AND D.A11 > 8000;", "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.client_id) FROM client C JOIN district D ON C.district_id = D.district_id WHERE C.gender = 'M' AND D.A3 = 'North Bohemia' AND D.A11 > 8000;"]

Question: 
How many male customers who are living in North Bohemia have average salary greater than 8000? 

Hint:
Male means that gender = 'M'; A3 refers to region; A11 pertains to average salary.

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To construct the SQL query for the question, we need to first identify the relevant tables and fields based on the provided schema. We are interested in counting male customers living in North Bohemia with an average salary greater than 8000. This involves querying the 'client' and 'district' tables. \n\nFirst, we recognize that gender filters male clients (`C.gender = 'M'`).

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM client C 
JOIN district D ON C.district_id = D.district_id 
WHERE C.gender = 'M' AND D.A3 = 'North Bohemia' 
GROUP BY C.client_id 
HAVING AVG(salary_column) > 8000;

["SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.client_id) FROM client C JOIN district D ON C.district_id = D.district_id WHERE C.gender = 'M' AND D.A3 = 'North Bohemia' AND D.A11 > 8000;", "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.client_id) FROM client C JOIN district D ON C.district_id = D.district_id WHERE C.gender = 'M' AND D.A3 = 'North Bohemia' AND D.A11 > 8000;", "SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT C.client_id) FROM client C JOIN district D ON C.district_id = D.district_id WHERE C.gender = 'M' AND D.A3 = 'North Bohemia' AND D.A11 > 8000;"]

Question: 
How many male customers who are living in North Bohemia have average salary greater than 8000? 

Hint:
Male means that gender = 'M'; A3 refers to region; A11 pertains to average salary.

    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To answer the question, we need to identify the number of male customers living in North Bohemia with an average salary greater than 8000. The relevant columns are found in the 'client' and 'district' tables. We know that 'gender' is stored in the 'client' table with M indicating male and that the region is indicated by A3 in the 'district' table. The average salary is stored in 'A11' of the 'district' table. \n\nFirstly, we will join the 'client' table (C) with the 'district' table (D) on 'district_id', allowing us to access the district information for each client. We then filter for male customers and those living in North Bohemia. \n\nNext, we need to group the results by client to compute the average salary. To reflect this in the SQL, we will use the AVG function in a HAVING clause to filter out those with an average salary above 8000. However, I will also include a COUNT function to sum the customers who meet this criteria. Finally, I'll use COUNT(*) instead of COUNT(DISTINCT C.client_id) to capture all entries satisfying the average condition without redundant client IDs. \n\nThe final SQL query will correctly reflect the required conditions and output as specified in the question.",
