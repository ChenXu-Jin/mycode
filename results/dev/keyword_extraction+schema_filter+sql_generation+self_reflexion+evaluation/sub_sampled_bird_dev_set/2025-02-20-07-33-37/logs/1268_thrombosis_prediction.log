Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Modify the filtering condition in the WHERE clause to accurately reflect what constitutes an 'abnormal anti-SM' test result. Determine the specific values that are considered abnormal (for instance, if there are known values like 'high', 'positive', etc.), and replace 'NOT IN ('-', '+-')' with the appropriate condition. For example: replace it with 'T1.SM IN (specific_negative_values)' if possible. 2. Ensure that the JOIN condition correctly links the Laboratory and Patient tables. If IDs should correlate differently, verify that the correct columns are being used. 3. Change the ORDER BY clause to use 'Birthday ASC' instead of 'Birthday DESC' to get the youngest patients first, since ordering in ascending order will bring the youngest birthdays to the top. 4. Finally, maintain the LIMIT of 3 for retrieving the three youngest patients. The revised SQL query could look something like this: `SELECT DISTINCT T1.ID FROM Laboratory T1 JOIN Patient T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1.SM IN (specific_negative_values) ORDER BY T2.Birthday ASC LIMIT 3;`

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT DISTINCT T1.ID FROM Laboratory T1 JOIN Patient T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1.SM NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY T2.Birthday DESC LIMIT 3;"]

Question: 
For the patients with an abnormal anti-SM, please list the IDs of the three youngest ones. 

Hint:
abnormal anti-SM refers to SM NOT IN('-', '+-'); youngest refers to MAX(Birthday);

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Identify the condition for 'abnormal anti-SM', which specifies that the SM value shouldn't be in ('-', '+-'). 2. Determine that 'youngest' refers to patients with the most recent Birthdays; therefore, I will need to order by Birthday in ascending order. 3. I'll retrieve distinct patient IDs from the Laboratory table where the SM condition is met and join that with the Patient table to access the Birthday. 4. I will use ORDER BY to sort by Birthday and LIMIT 3 to get just the three youngest patients. This aligns with the goals outlined in long-term memory (like avoiding MAX, including the necessary conditions, and using order effectively). 5. I also ensure the correct join is applied between Laboratory and Patient tables based on their IDs. The final SQL query reflects these steps clearly.",

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
For the patients with an abnormal anti-SM, please list the IDs of the three youngest ones.

SQL Query:
SELECT DISTINCT T1.ID FROM Laboratory T1 JOIN Patient T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1.SM NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY T2.Birthday ASC LIMIT 3;

Database Content:
{'Examination': ['ID', 'Examination Date', 'aCL IgG', 'aCL IgM', 'ANA', 'ANA Pattern', 'aCL IgA', 'Diagnosis', 'KCT', 'RVVT', 'LAC', 'Symptoms', 'Thrombosis'], 'Patient': ['ID', 'SEX', 'Birthday', 'Description', 'First Date', 'Admission', 'Diagnosis'], 'Laboratory': ['ID', 'Date', 'GOT', 'GPT', 'LDH', 'ALP', 'TP', 'ALB', 'UA', 'UN', 'CRE', 'T-BIL', 'T-CHO', 'TG', 'CPK', 'GLU', 'WBC', 'RBC', 'HGB', 'HCT', 'PLT', 'PT', 'APTT', 'FG', 'PIC', 'TAT', 'TAT2', 'U-PRO', 'IGG', 'IGA', 'IGM', 'CRP', 'RA', 'RF', 'C3', 'C4', 'RNP', 'SM', 'SC170', 'SSA', 'SSB', 'CENTROMEA', 'DNA', 'DNA-II']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the IDs of the three youngest patients with an abnormal anti-SM test result. To meet this requirement, the SQL query checks for patients whose lab results contain an 'SM' value that is neither '-' nor '+-' (which implies abnormalities) and should sort these patients by their 'Birthday' in ascending order to find the youngest ones. The query also limits the results to three entries, which aligns with the request in the question. The structure of the SQL query correctly uses a JOIN to combine data from the 'Laboratory' and 'Patient' tables, ensuring that the IDs selected are from patients who have abnormal results. Therefore, it correctly fulfills the conditions stated in the question and would yield the expected output accordingly.",
