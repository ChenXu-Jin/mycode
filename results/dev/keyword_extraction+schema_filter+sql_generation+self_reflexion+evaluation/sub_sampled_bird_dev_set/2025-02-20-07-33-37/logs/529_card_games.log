This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Find and list the names of sets which doesn't have Japanese translation but have Korean translation. 

Hint:
names of sets refers to name; doesn't have Japanese translation refers to language not like '%Japanese%'; have Korean translation refers to language = 'Korean'

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Use inner joins or subqueries to separately identify sets with Korean translations and exclude sets with Japanese translations. 2. Modify the WHERE clause to ensure that it only includes sets that have a Korean translation and do not have any Japanese translations. 3. Specifically, check for the existence of a Korean translation while ensuring that no Japanese translation exists. Here is a revised SQL query: 

```
SELECT T1.name 
FROM sets T1 
JOIN set_translations T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode AND T2.language = 'Korean' 
LEFT JOIN set_translations T3 ON T1.code = T3.setCode AND T3.language = 'Japanese' 
WHERE T3.language IS NULL;
```

This query joins the sets with translations for both Korean and Japanese, ensuring that only sets with Korean translation are included and simultaneously filtering out any that also have a Japanese translation.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.name FROM sets T1 LEFT JOIN set_translations T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode WHERE T2.language IS NULL OR T2.language NOT LIKE '%Japanese%' AND T2.language = 'Korean'"]

Question: 
Find and list the names of sets which doesn't have Japanese translation but have Korean translation. 

Hint:
names of sets refers to name; doesn't have Japanese translation refers to language not like '%Japanese%'; have Korean translation refers to language = 'Korean'

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Find and list the names of sets which doesn't have Japanese translation but have Korean translation.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.name FROM sets T1 JOIN set_translations T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode AND T2.language = 'Korean' LEFT JOIN set_translations T3 ON T1.code = T3.setCode AND T3.language = 'Japanese' WHERE T3.language IS NULL;

Database Content:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the names of sets that do not have a Japanese translation but do have a Korean translation. The SQL query employs a JOIN to relate the 'sets' table to the 'set_translations' table in order to retrieve the names of sets. It checks for a Japanese translation being absent using a LEFT JOIN with a condition that verifies the absence of Japanese translations (T3.language IS NULL). However, the query correctly requires that Korean translations exist for each set (T2.language = 'Korean'). Both conditions appear to be correctly represented in the SQL syntax. Therefore, the SQL query should return the correct results as per the question's request, assuming the execution result aligns accurately with the expected output described in the question.",
