This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Which drivers who were born in 1971 and has the fastest lap time on the race? Give id and code of these drivers.

SQL Query:
SELECT D.driverId, D.code FROM drivers D JOIN results R ON D.driverId = R.driverId WHERE strftime('%Y', D.dob) = '1971' AND R.fastestLapTime IS NOT NULL

Database Content:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query so that it accurately retrieves the drivers born in 1971 who have the fastest lap time, follow these steps: 1. First, ensure you are selecting only those drivers who actually had the fastest lap time in any race. To do this, you can use a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) to determine the maximum fastest lap time for drivers born in 1971. 2. Update the WHERE clause such that it checks not just for a non-null fastest lap time, but confirms that the driver's fastest lap time is equal to the maximum fastest lap time found for that driver among all races. 3. Make sure the selection is limited to drivers born in 1971 as originally intended. Here is a possible SQL structure to achieve this: \n\nWITH FastestLaps AS (\n    SELECT driverId, MAX(fastestLapTime) AS maxLapTime\n    FROM results\n    GROUP BY driverId\n) \nSELECT D.driverId, D.code \nFROM drivers D \nJOIN FastestLaps F ON D.driverId = F.driverId \nWHERE strftime('%Y', D.dob) = '1971' AND F.maxLapTime IS NOT NULL;"

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it accurately retrieves the drivers born in 1971 who have the fastest lap time, follow these steps: 1. First, ensure you are selecting only those drivers who actually had the fastest lap time in any race. To do this, you can use a subquery or CTE (Common Table Expression) to determine the maximum fastest lap time for drivers born in 1971. 2. Update the WHERE clause such that it checks not just for a non-null fastest lap time, but confirms that the driver's fastest lap time is equal to the maximum fastest lap time found for that driver among all races. 3. Make sure the selection is limited to drivers born in 1971 as originally intended. Here is a possible SQL structure to achieve this: 

WITH FastestLaps AS (
    SELECT driverId, MAX(fastestLapTime) AS maxLapTime
    FROM results
    GROUP BY driverId
) 
SELECT D.driverId, D.code 
FROM drivers D 
JOIN FastestLaps F ON D.driverId = F.driverId 
WHERE strftime('%Y', D.dob) = '1971' AND F.maxLapTime IS NOT NULL;

["SELECT D.driverId, D.code FROM drivers D JOIN results R ON D.driverId = R.driverId WHERE strftime('%Y', D.dob) = '1971' AND R.fastestLapTime IS NOT NULL"]

Question: 
Which drivers who were born in 1971 and has the fastest lap time on the race? Give id and code of these drivers. 

Hint:
born in 1971 refers to year(dob) = 1971; has the fastest lap time refers to fastestLapTime has values

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
