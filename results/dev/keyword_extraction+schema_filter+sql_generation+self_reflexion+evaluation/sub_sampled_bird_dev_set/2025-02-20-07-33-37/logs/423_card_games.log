This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Please provide the ids of top three powerful pairs of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards sorted by Kingdom Foil id in alphabetical order.

SQL Query:
SELECT id FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC LIMIT 3;

Database Content:
{'cards': ['id', 'artist', 'asciiName', 'availability', 'borderColor', 'cardKingdomFoilId', 'cardKingdomId', 'colorIdentity', 'colorIndicator', 'colors', 'convertedManaCost', 'duelDeck', 'edhrecRank', 'faceConvertedManaCost', 'faceName', 'flavorName', 'flavorText', 'frameEffects', 'frameVersion', 'hand', 'hasAlternativeDeckLimit', 'hasContentWarning', 'hasFoil', 'hasNonFoil', 'isAlternative', 'isFullArt', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isOversized', 'isPromo', 'isReprint', 'isReserved', 'isStarter', 'isStorySpotlight', 'isTextless', 'isTimeshifted', 'keywords', 'layout', 'leadershipSkills', 'life', 'loyalty', 'manaCost', 'mcmId', 'mcmMetaId', 'mtgArenaId', 'mtgjsonV4Id', 'mtgoFoilId', 'mtgoId', 'multiverseId', 'name', 'number', 'originalReleaseDate', 'originalText', 'originalType', 'otherFaceIds', 'power', 'printings', 'promoTypes', 'purchaseUrls', 'rarity', 'scryfallId', 'scryfallIllustrationId', 'scryfallOracleId', 'setCode', 'side', 'subtypes', 'supertypes', 'tcgplayerProductId', 'text', 'toughness', 'type', 'types', 'uuid', 'variations', 'watermark'], 'foreign_data': ['id', 'flavorText', 'language', 'multiverseid', 'name', 'text', 'type', 'uuid'], 'legalities': ['id', 'format', 'status', 'uuid'], 'sets': ['id', 'baseSetSize', 'block', 'booster', 'code', 'isFoilOnly', 'isForeignOnly', 'isNonFoilOnly', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isPartialPreview', 'keyruneCode', 'mcmId', 'mcmIdExtras', 'mcmName', 'mtgoCode', 'name', 'parentCode', 'releaseDate', 'tcgplayerGroupId', 'totalSetSize', 'type'], 'set_translations': ['id', 'language', 'setCode', 'translation'], 'rulings': ['id', 'date', 'text', 'uuid']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "feedback": "To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these specific steps: 1. Join the 'cards' table with the 'kingdom_foils' and 'kingdom_cards' tables (or equivalent tables) to access information for both 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards.' 2. Ensure that you are selecting ids that represent pairs of both 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards' by including the appropriate identifiers for both in your select statement. 3. Introduce a filter that measures the 'power' of the pairs, if such information is available, for example by a 'power_level' attribute. If no explicit power metric exists, clarify the definition of 'powerful' for further criteria. 4. Update the ORDER BY clause to sort by 'cardKingdomFoilId' and ensure that it reflects a meaningful order related to power if applicable. Here's a modified SQL example for clarity: SELECT kf.id AS kingdomFoilId, kc.id AS kingdomCardId FROM kingdom_foils kf JOIN kingdom_cards kc ON kf.id = kc.kingdomFoilId WHERE kf.id IS NOT NULL AND kc.id IS NOT NULL ORDER BY kf.id ASC LIMIT 3;"

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these specific steps: 1. Join the 'cards' table with the 'kingdom_foils' and 'kingdom_cards' tables (or equivalent tables) to access information for both 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards.' 2. Ensure that you are selecting ids that represent pairs of both 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards' by including the appropriate identifiers for both in your select statement. 3. Introduce a filter that measures the 'power' of the pairs, if such information is available, for example by a 'power_level' attribute. If no explicit power metric exists, clarify the definition of 'powerful' for further criteria. 4. Update the ORDER BY clause to sort by 'cardKingdomFoilId' and ensure that it reflects a meaningful order related to power if applicable. Here's a modified SQL example for clarity: SELECT kf.id AS kingdomFoilId, kc.id AS kingdomCardId FROM kingdom_foils kf JOIN kingdom_cards kc ON kf.id = kc.kingdomFoilId WHERE kf.id IS NOT NULL AND kc.id IS NOT NULL ORDER BY kf.id ASC LIMIT 3;

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Modify the SELECT statement to include both 'cardKingdomFoilId' and 'cardKingdomId' to retrieve the IDs of the pairs rather than just one. Use 'DISTINCT' if necessary to avoid duplicate pairs. 
2. Join the 'cards' table with itself or use another appropriate table to combine the concepts of 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards', ensuring that the output can represent pairs. 
3. Clearly define a criteria for what constitutes a 'powerful pair', and integrate any necessary conditions to filter based on this criteria. This may involve additional JOINs or WHERE clauses, depending on how power is defined. 
4. Update the ORDER BY clause to sort by 'cardKingdomFoilId' as specified and ensure that the output includes both types of IDs properly formatted as pairs. 
5. Keep the LIMIT clause to 3 to comply with the request for only the top three pairs.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT id FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC LIMIT 3;', 'SELECT id FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC LIMIT 3;', 'SELECT id FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC LIMIT 3;']

Question: 
Please provide the ids of top three powerful pairs of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards sorted by Kingdom Foil id in alphabetical order. 

Hint:
poweful refers to cardKingdomFoilId is not null AND cardKingdomId is not null

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To construct the SQL query based on the question, I need to find the top three pairs of 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards', which is defined by the IDs 'cardKingdomFoilId' and 'cardKingdomId' being non-null. I will ensure that both of these IDs are selected in my output. The IDs need to be sorted by 'cardKingdomFoilId' in alphabetical order and the output should be limited to the top three entries. Following the guiding principles, I will filter for non-null values and use ORDER BY with LIMIT to achieve the requested results. The final output will include displaying the IDs as distinct pairs without additional aggregation or concatenation. Therefore, based on these criteria, the SQL query becomes: SELECT DISTINCT cardKingdomFoilId, cardKingdomId FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC LIMIT 3.",
