You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE customers (
  CustomerID INTEGER UNIQUE     not null
        primary key,
  Segment    TEXT null,
  Currency   TEXT null
);

CREATE TABLE gasstations (
  GasStationID INTEGER    UNIQUE   not null
        primary key,
  ChainID      INTEGER          null,
  Country      TEXT null,
  Segment      TEXT null
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  ProductID   INTEGER   UNIQUE      not null
        primary key,
  Description TEXT null
);

CREATE TABLE transactions_1k (
  TransactionID INTEGER
        primary key autoincrement,
  Date          DATE,
  Time          TEXT,
  CustomerID    INTEGER,
  CardID        INTEGER,
  GasStationID  INTEGER,
  ProductID     INTEGER,
  Amount        INTEGER,
  Price         REAL
);

CREATE TABLE yearmonth (
  CustomerID  INTEGER not null
        references customers
            on update cascade on delete cascade
        references customers,
  Date        TEXT    not null,
  Consumption REAL,
  primary key (Date, CustomerID)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to include the 'Consumption' status from the 'yearmonth' table in the SELECT statement. Here are the specific steps to modify the query: 1. Adjust the SELECT clause to include the 'Consumption' column along with 'CustomerID'. For example: SELECT T2.CustomerID, T2.Consumption. 2. Ensure that the join between 'transactions_1k' and 'yearmonth' correctly reflects the relationship needed to get the consumption status. 3. After including the Consumption status, confirm that you are still filtering on the correct conditions for ProductID 5 and the price condition. An updated query might look like this: SELECT T2.CustomerID, T2.Consumption FROM transactions_1k T1 JOIN yearmonth T2 ON T1.CustomerID = T2.CustomerID WHERE T1.ProductID = 5 AND (T1.Price / T1.Amount) > 29.00 AND T2.Date LIKE '201208%'.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.

1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure that the SQL query aligns with the question's intent, you should take the following specific actions: 1. Modify the date filtering condition to accurately extract only records from August 2012 by changing 'T2.Date LIKE '201208%'' to 'T2.Date = '2012-08-01' OR T2.Date = '2012-08-02' OR ... OR T2.Date = '2012-08-31'' or use a date range filter. 2. Ensure that the date column in the 'yearmonth' table is formatted consistently. Depending on your database, consider using a date function to filter dates (e.g., SCAST or CONVERT in SQL Server) to ensure you capture all records strictly within August 2012. 3. Review the division in the price condition to ensure it correctly computes price per unit and returns results specifically for transactions where this value exceeds 29.00. Utilizing clearer date handling will prevent unwanted records from other months or years being included in your results.

Start by identifying the relevant tables: 'transactions_1k' (to check the transaction details) and 'yearmonth' (to identify consumption status in August 2012). 2.

Next, filter the records to include only those from August 2012 by checking 'yearmonth.Date' formatted as '201208%'. 5. Since the question requests consumption status, I will select 'T2.Consumption', along with 'T2.CustomerID' to identify the customers. 6.
