This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure the SQL query accurately identifies the user who specifically added a bounty amount of 50 to a post with the title mentioning 'variance', you need to add a condition that checks for the correct VoteTypeId corresponding to bounties. Modify the SQL query by including a condition that specifies the VoteTypeId should equal the value that represents a bounty in your database schema. The modified SQL query should be as follows: SELECT T1.UserId FROM votes T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.PostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.BountyAmount = 50 AND T2.Title LIKE '%variance%' AND T1.VoteTypeId = [BountyVoteTypeId]; Be sure to replace [BountyVoteTypeId] with the actual ID that signifies a bounty in your database.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To find which user added a bounty amount of 50 to a post with a title mentioning 'variance', I need to focus on the 'votes' and 'posts' tables since the bounty amounts and post information are stored in these tables, respectively. The question specifies that the bounty amount is exactly 50, which I will represent as 'BountyAmount = 50'. Additionally, I need to join 'votes' and 'posts' on 'PostId' to tie the voting information to the corresponding post. I also want to filter the posts by their title to ensure it contains the term 'variance'. Furthermore, since the desired output is the display name of the user who made the bounty, I should include the 'DisplayName' from the 'users' table, which I can access by joining it with the 'votes' table on 'UserId'. I will make sure to include conditions for both the bounty amount and the title while using an appropriate JOIN to link the tables. The resulting query should fetch the corresponding user's display name.",
    "SQL": "SELECT U.DisplayName FROM votes V JOIN posts P ON V.PostId = P.Id JOIN users U ON V.UserId = U.Id WHERE V.BountyAmount = 50 AND P.Title LIKE '%variance%' AND V.VoteTypeId = [BountyVoteTypeId];"
