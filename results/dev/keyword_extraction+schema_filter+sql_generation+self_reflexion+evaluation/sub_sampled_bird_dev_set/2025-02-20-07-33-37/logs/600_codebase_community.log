This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to meet the requirements of the question, you need to include a separate selection for the popularity of the original post (ID 61217) along with the related posts. Here are the steps: 1. Use a UNION to combine two SELECT statements: one that retrieves the popularity of the original post and another that retrieves the related posts. 2. In the first SELECT statement, fetch the Id and ViewCount where the Id equals 61217. 3. In the second SELECT statement, continue to fetch the Id and ViewCount of related posts as currently defined. 4. Ensure both queries have the same column names for a proper UNION. Here is your modified SQL query:

```sql

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the intent of the question, modify the query to explicitly include the view counts for all related posts retrieved through the join operation. Instead of just fetching the Id and ViewCount of post ID 61217, ensure that you also select both the Id and ViewCount for the related posts identified in the 'postLinks' table. The updated SQL query should look like this: 

```sql
SELECT Id, ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217 
UNION SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 
JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id 
WHERE T1.PostId = 61217;
```

This query correctly retrieves the ID and view count for both post ID 61217 and all posts related to it, ensuring that the result fully satisfies the question's requirements.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217', 'SELECT Id, ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217 UNION SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217;']

Question: 
List out all post that are related to post ID 61217 and what is the popularity of this post? 

Hint:
post related refers to RelatedPostId; popularity refers to ViewCount

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to fully align with the question's intent, you should include the popularity (ViewCount) of post ID 61217 in the final result alongside the related posts. Instead of using UNION, which produces two separate result sets, use a single SELECT statement with a CASE statement or a common table expression (CTE) to include the ViewCount of post ID 61217 in the result set. Here is a suggested SQL modification: 

WITH RelatedPosts AS ( 
    SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount 
    FROM postLinks AS T1 
    JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id 
    WHERE T1.PostId = 61217 
) 
SELECT 61217 AS Id, (SELECT ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217) AS ViewCount 
UNION ALL 
SELECT Id, ViewCount FROM RelatedPosts;

Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217', 'SELECT Id, ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217 UNION SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217;', 'SELECT Id, ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217 UNION SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217;']

Question: 
List out all post that are related to post ID 61217 and what is the popularity of this post? 

Hint:
post related refers to RelatedPostId; popularity refers to ViewCount

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To address the question, I first need to identify how to retrieve posts related to post ID 61217. The schema indicates that related posts can be found through the 'postLinks' table, where 'PostId' refers to the original post (in this case, 61217) and 'RelatedPostId' refers to the posts that are connected. I also need to include the popularity (ViewCount) of post ID 61217, which is stored in the 'posts' table. Using a UNION is not required here, as I can retrieve all necessary data in a single query using a common table expression (CTE) to gather related posts. I've decided to create a CTE to fetch the related posts and then combine the result with the ViewCount of post ID 61217. Based on the guiding principles, I will include the popularity of post 61217 in the output avoid additional unnecessary columns unless specified and keep it streamlined. Therefore, I will structure the SQL query to achieve all these requirements efficiently.",
    "SQL": "WITH RelatedPosts AS ( SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217 ) SELECT 61217 AS Id, (SELECT ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217) AS ViewCount UNION ALL SELECT Id, ViewCount FROM RelatedPosts;"
