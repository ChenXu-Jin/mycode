This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so it aligns with the question's intent, consider the following steps: 1. **Clarify Issuance Statement Context**: Ensure there is a column or table that represents the choice of a statement of issuance. This may require verifying the schema or data structure. 2. **Integrate 'Disponent' Criteria**: Add a filter that specifically checks for clients who fall under the 'Disponent' categories. This might involve modifying the join conditions or adding another table that categorizes clients or account roles. 3. **Adjust the Operation Condition**: If 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' is not directly related to the issuance choice, consider adding the correct operation that relates to the statement of issuance. If a different transaction is indicative of this choice, update the WHERE clause to reflect that. 4. **Reassess JOINs and Conditions**: Examine the necessary relationships between tables. You may need to LEFT JOIN additional tables to access the pertinent information to determine the relationship of clients to both the issuance and the category of 'Disponent'. 5. **Example of a New Structure**: An example structure could resemble: 'SELECT DISTINCT T1.client_id FROM client T1 INNER JOIN disp T2 ON T1.client_id = T2.client_id INNER JOIN trans T3 ON T2.account_id = T3.account_id WHERE T3.operation IN ('RELEVANT_OPERATION_FOR_ISSUANCE') AND T2.role = 'Disponent'' to include both criteria more accurately.

The term 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' is given to indicate this type of issuance following a transaction. We also know that clients who choose this option must fall under the 'Disponent' category. To construct this SQL query: 1. Start by joining the 'client', 'disp', and 'trans' tables to relate clients to their associated transactions. 2.

2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. **Identify Statement of Issuance**: First, ensure that there is a clear definition of 'statement of issuance' in your database. This might be a specific table or a column that signifies when a client has chosen to receive a statement. You need to incorporate that condition into your query. 2. **Add Condition for 'Statement of Issuance'**: Incorporate a condition that selects clients who have chosen 'statement of issuance'. This could involve adding a join to a relevant table (if it exists), or a condition in the WHERE clause that checks for a column in an existing table that indicates the issuance choice. 3. **Clarify Transaction Order**: Ensure that you're checking for the issuance selection should occur after the specified transaction. This could involve adding a condition for comparing the dates of the transaction and the issuance statement. If you have timestamps for the issuance and the transaction, utilize that to filter the results. 4. **Final Query Structure**: Your final SQL query might resemble the following structure: SELECT DISTINCT T1.client_id FROM client T1 INNER JOIN disp T2 ON T1.client_id = T2.client_id INNER JOIN trans T3 ON T2.account_id = T3.account_id INNER JOIN issuance_table T4 ON T1.client_id = T4.client_id WHERE T3.operation = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' AND T2.type = 'Disponent' AND T4.issuance_choice = 'statement' AND T4.date > T3.transaction_date; Adjust the 'issuance_table', the 'issuance_choice', and the dates as per your schema details. 5. **Test the Query**: After adjustments, execute the query in your SQL environment to confirm it returns the expected result.

Short-Term Memory:

    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To construct the SQL query, I need to identify the clients who choose a statement of issuance after conducting a transaction specifically categorized as Disponent. Given that 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' represents a transaction type associated with issuance, I will look for clients who have performed this operation. \n\n1. Start with the 'client' table to identify all clients and their attributes.\n2. Join the 'disp' table on the client_id to establish which clients have a disp (disposition) record and to filter for those disposers categorized as 'Disponent'.\n3. Next, join the 'trans' table where we are interested in transactions of type 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' to find the relevant financial activities related to these clients.\n4. I need to output distinct client IDs to ensure each client is listed only once in the results. \n5. The condition of being a Disponent will be maintained during the JOIN operation to ensure it filters correctly.\n6. Review the relationships established in the schema to ensure all relevant joins accurately reflect the underlying data model.\n7. Finally, given the requirements of the question, I will avoid unnecessary columns in the SELECT clause, focusing solely on client_id.",
