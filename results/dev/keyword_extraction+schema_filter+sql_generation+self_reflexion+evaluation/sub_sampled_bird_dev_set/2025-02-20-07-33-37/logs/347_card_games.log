This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Correct the artist's name in the query from 'Stephen Daniele' to 'Stephen Daniel' to ensure the correct filtering of cards illustrated by the right artist. 
2. Modify the SELECT clause to include additional columns that represent properties and values of the cards, such as 'hasMissingProperties' or 'isDegraded', if these columns exist in the 'cards' table. These columns should reflect whether the cards have missing or degraded properties. 
3. If the properties indicating missing or degraded values are stored in a different table, consider JOINing that table to retrieve the relevant data. 
4. Ensure the WHERE clause comprehensively covers all required conditions. The final SQL query might look something like this: 

```sql 
SELECT T1.id, T3.text, T1.hasMissingProperties, T1.isDegraded FROM cards AS T1 JOIN rulings AS T3 ON T1.uuid = T3.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel'; 
``` 
5. Test the modified query to ensure it returns the expected results that align with the original question.

Hint:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To formulate the correct SQL query based on the requirements, I began by interpreting the question's intent. The goal is to find all cards illustrated by 'Stephen Daniel' and gather the text of the rulings associated with these cards. Additionally, we need to check if these cards have missing or degraded properties indicated by the presence of a content warning (where hasContentWarning = 1). Given the schema, I recognized that the relevant tables involved are 'cards' for the card information and 'rulings' for the ruling text. \n\n1. I need to join the 'cards' table (aliased as T1) and the 'rulings' table (aliased as T3) using the uuid field from both tables, as this will allow me to retrieve the associated ruling text for each card. \n\n2. Secondly, I will filter for cards illustrated by 'Stephen Daniel'. It's important to note that the question mistakenly listed the artist as 'Stephen Daniele', so I will use the correct name in the WHERE clause. \n\n3. I will also include a filter to check for cards with a content warning, indicating that they have missing or degraded properties. The relevant column for this check is 'hasContentWarning', which should equal 1. \n\n4. Finally, in the SELECT clause, I\u2019ll retrieve the card id, the text of the ruling, and include columns for 'hasMissingProperties' and 'isDegraded' (if they exist), assuming they can represent missing or degraded properties. However, since the question doesn\u2019t specify exact additional properties beyond the content warning, I focused on the available data.\n\n5. The final SQL query will incorporate these details while adhering to the guiding principles of SQL generation. Therefore, the SQL query ends up being: \n\nSELECT T1.id, T3.text, T1.hasContentWarning FROM cards AS T1 JOIN rulings AS T3 ON T1.uuid = T3.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;",

2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Include additional columns in the SELECT statement to assess the completeness of card properties. For instance, check for null or empty values in properties that indicate whether the card is missing or degraded. 2. Add additional filters in the WHERE clause to check for any conditions that define missing or degraded properties (e.g., T1.property IS NULL or T1.value < threshold). 3. Ensure proper joins with necessary tables that contain quality or condition information about the cards, if available. For example, if there is a 'card_properties' table that lists property status, include it in the JOIN clause. The modified query might look like: SELECT T1.id, T3.text, T1.hasContentWarning, T1.property_status FROM cards AS T1 JOIN rulings AS T3 ON T1.uuid = T3.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND (T1.property IS NULL OR T1.value < threshold). Adjust based on the specific schema of your database.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.id, T3.text FROM cards AS T1 JOIN rulings AS T3 ON T1.uuid = T3.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniele' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;", "SELECT T1.id, T3.text, T1.hasContentWarning FROM cards AS T1 JOIN rulings AS T3 ON T1.uuid = T3.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;", "SELECT T1.id, T3.text, T1.hasContentWarning FROM cards AS T1 JOIN rulings AS T3 ON T1.uuid = T3.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel'"]

Question: 
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values. 

Hint:
cards have missing or degraded properties and value refers to hasContentWarning = 1; 'Stephen Daniele' is artist;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
