This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Among the accounts who have approved loan date in 1997, list out the accounts that have the lowest approved amount and choose weekly issuance statement.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.account_id FROM loan AS T1 JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id WHERE T1.date LIKE '1997%' AND T1.status = 'approved' AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE' ORDER BY T1.amount ASC LIMIT 1

Database Content:
{'account': ['account_id', 'district_id', 'frequency', 'date'], 'card': ['card_id', 'disp_id', 'type', 'issued'], 'client': ['client_id', 'gender', 'birth_date', 'district_id'], 'disp': ['disp_id', 'client_id', 'account_id', 'type'], 'district': ['district_id', 'A2', 'A3', 'A4', 'A5', 'A6', 'A7', 'A8', 'A9', 'A10', 'A11', 'A12', 'A13', 'A14', 'A15', 'A16'], 'loan': ['loan_id', 'account_id', 'date', 'amount', 'duration', 'payments', 'status'], 'order': ['order_id', 'account_id', 'bank_to', 'account_to', 'amount', 'k_symbol'], 'trans': ['trans_id', 'account_id', 'date', 'type', 'operation', 'amount', 'balance', 'k_symbol', 'bank', 'account']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question requires listing accounts with the lowest approved loan amount among those who had their loan approved in 1997, specifically focusing on accounts with a weekly issuance frequency. The provided SQL query attempts to do this by joining the 'loan' and 'account' tables on account_id, filtering for loans approved in 1997, and checking for the specific frequency of 'POPLATEK TYDNE'. It orders the results by amount in ascending order and limits the results to one entry to find the lowest amount. Overall, the SQL query correctly implements the necessary conditions stated in the question. However, the phrasing of the frequency in the question may be somewhat different from what is in the database (it states a weekly issuance statement, while the query uses 'POPLATEK TYDNE'). Assuming 'POPLATEK TYDNE' translates correctly to a weekly frequency, the fundamental logic aligns. In summary, the query accurately queries the intended criteria despite a potential translation issue, suggesting that it is indeed valid.",
    "judgment": "Valid"
