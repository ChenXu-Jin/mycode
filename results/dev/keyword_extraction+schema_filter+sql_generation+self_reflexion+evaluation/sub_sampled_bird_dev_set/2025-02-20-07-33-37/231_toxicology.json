We will aggregate the bond types and count their occurrences, sorting them in descending order and limiting the result to just one entry to get the majority bond type. Additionally, we need to determine if this molecule is carcinogenic by checking its label in the molecule table, which we will join to ensure we only look at the right molecule. Since the question requires both the bond type and the carcinogenic status, we will select both of these in a single query.",
