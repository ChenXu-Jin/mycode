First, I need to identify which tables hold the relevant information. The budget amount is found in the 'budget' table, and the specific event is linked in this table by the 'link_to_event' column that references the 'event_id' in the 'event' table. I will need to join these two tables based on this relationship. Using the event name 'September Speaker', I can filter the event from the 'event' table, and then sum the 'amount' from the 'budget' table for that particular event. The final SQL query will include a SUM function to get the total amount, and it will be filtered for the specific event.",
