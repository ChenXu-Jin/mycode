The filter conditions are: height_cm BETWEEN 150 AND 180 and publisher_id = 13 for Marvel Comics. Then, to calculate the percentage, I will use the formula mentioned in the question. Specifically, I will count the number of superheroes published by Marvel in that height range and divide it by the total number of superheroes in that same height range. I will then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. To structure the query, I will use a subquery to count the heroes published by Marvel and another to count the total superheroes within the height constraint. Finally, I will select the computed percentage.",
