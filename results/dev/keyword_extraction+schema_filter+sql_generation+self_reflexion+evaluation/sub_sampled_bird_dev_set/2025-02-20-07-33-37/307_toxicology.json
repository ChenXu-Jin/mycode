After identifying the connected atoms, I need to look up their elements from the 'atom' table. The steps are as follows: 1. I will filter the 'bond' table to get the bond with ID 'TR000_2_3'. 2. Then, I'll join this with the 'connected' table to find the corresponding atom IDs that are connected by this bond. 3. Finally, I will join this result with the 'atom' table to get the elements of the identified atoms. I will ensure that only the 'element' column is selected as that is the only requested information.",
