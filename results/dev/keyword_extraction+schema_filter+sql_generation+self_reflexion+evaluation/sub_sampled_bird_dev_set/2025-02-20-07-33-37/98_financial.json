The relevant tables for this are the 'loan' table for loan details and the 'account' table for account details. I will need to filter out loans that are specifically approved and are dated within the year 1997. After that, I will need to find the account with the lowest approved loan amount. Finally, I need to filter the accounts to list only those with a frequency of 'POPLATEK TYDNE', which refers to weekly issuance. Based on the table structure, necessary joins will be made between 'loan' and 'account' using their respective foreign key relationships to select only the account_id as required by the instructions.",
