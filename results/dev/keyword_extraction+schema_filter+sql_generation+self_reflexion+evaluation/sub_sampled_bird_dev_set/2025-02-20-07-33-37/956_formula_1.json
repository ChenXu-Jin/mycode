The relevant tables for this query are the 'drivers' table, which contains the date of birth (dob), and the 'driverStandings' table, which contains the rankings. We will need to join these two tables on the driverId to filter the appropriate records. The condition for birth year is that the year part of the 'dob' should be greater than 1975. In the result, we only need the forenames and surnames of the qualifying drivers. Therefore, our SELECT clause will include the 'forename' and 'surname' columns from the 'drivers' table, while the filtering and joining will be done appropriately based on the schema.",
