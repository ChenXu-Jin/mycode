First, I will filter for charter schools by selecting rows where 'Charter School (Y/N)' = 1 in the 'frpm' table. For the enrollment criterion, I will look for the 'Enrollment (K-12)' column to determine the number of students enrolled. Using an ORDER BY statement with LIMIT 1 will allow me to find the school with the minimum enrollment. To get the email address of the administrator, I will join the two tables based on the 'CDSCode'. The final query will select the administrator's email from the 'schools' table, ensuring only the relevant columns are included.",
