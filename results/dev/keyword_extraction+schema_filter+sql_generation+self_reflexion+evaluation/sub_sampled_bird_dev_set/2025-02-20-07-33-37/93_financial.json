First, I will filter clients by gender and by the district that corresponds to North Bohemia. For filtering by district, I'll use the A3 column in the 'district' table. After filtering for gender = 'M', I also need to check the average salary from column A11 in the district table. I'll join the 'client' and 'district' tables on the district_id to access both gender and salary information. Finally, I will use a COUNT operation to get the total number of clients that meet all these criteria.
