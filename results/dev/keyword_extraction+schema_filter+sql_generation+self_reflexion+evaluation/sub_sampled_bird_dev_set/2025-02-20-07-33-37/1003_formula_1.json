Since incidents (or accidents) are denoted by statusId equal to 3, I will need to reference the 'results' table which includes the statusId column. I\u2019ll also need to filter results by the specific race - the Canadian Grand Prix - which is located in the 'races' table. Here\u2019s how I\u2019ll form the query step by step: 1. Start by identifying the raceId of the Canadian Grand Prix from the 'races' table by filtering on the name. 2. In the 'results' table, count the occurrences of accidents (statusId = 3) for each driver associated with that race. 3. Use ORDER BY to identify the driver with the maximum count of accidents and use LIMIT 1 to ensure I only fetch one record. 4. Finally, I will select the counted accidents for this driver. The resulting SQL query will reflect this logic.",
