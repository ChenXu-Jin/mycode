First, I need to count the total number of superheroes whose height is between 150 and 180. Second, I need to find the number of superheroes whose height is between 150 and 180 and are published by 'Marvel Comics'. Finally, I need to divide the second number by the first number and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. The publisher id for Marvel Comics is 13.\n\nI will use a subquery to filter heroes by height and then join with the publisher table to determine if the hero is published by Marvel Comics.  I will use COUNT to count the number of such heroes and compute the percentage. Finally, I will filter out null height values.\n\nAlternative solution: Calculate the percentage directly within the query, but this makes the query a little long. I would prefer to calculate the percentage outside the query.",
