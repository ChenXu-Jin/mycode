The number of double bonds requires filtering the 'bond' table on 'bond_type' equal to ' = ' and 'molecule_id' equal to 'TR006' and then counting the resulting rows. Carcinogenicity can be determined by checking the 'molecule' table if the label for 'molecule_id' TR006 is '+'. I must join the molecule table and the bond table on molecule_id to generate a query that returns the count of double bonds and whether the molecule is carcinogenic. Since '+' means carcinogenic and '-' means non-carcinogenic, I will convert the label column values to true or false.",
