To answer this question, I need to identify the race that happened on 2015/11/29 and then count the number of drivers who finished the race. I can find the race ID from the `races` table based on the date. Then I can use the `results` table to find the drivers who participated in that race and filter those drivers based on the `statusId` column. Finally, I count the number of drivers who finished the race. From the prompt, 'drivers who finished the race should have record in time', thus, the filtering condition should be time is not NULL. The final step is counting the number of drivers satisfying the aforementioned conditions.",
