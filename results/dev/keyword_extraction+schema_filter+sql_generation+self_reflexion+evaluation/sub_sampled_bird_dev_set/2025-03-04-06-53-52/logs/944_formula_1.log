Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?
Hint: how much faster in percentage = divide(subtract(incremental time, champion time), last_driver time) * 100%; last driver finished time = incremental time + champion time; only champion's finished time is represented by 'HH:MM:SS.mmm'; finished the game refers to time is not null

Please provide your findings as a Python list, capturing the essence of both the question and hint through the identified terms and phrases. 
Only output the Python list, no explanations needed.

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Question: 
How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix? 

Hint:
how much faster in percentage = divide(subtract(incremental time, champion time), last_driver time) * 100%; last driver finished time = incremental time + champion time; only champion's finished time is represented by 'HH:MM:SS.mmm'; finished the game refers to time is not null

{
    "feedback": "1. **Handle NULL `milliseconds` values:** The `milliseconds` column can contain NULL values, especially for drivers who didn't finish the race. Use `WHERE T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL AND T2.milliseconds IS NOT NULL` to exclude these rows in the subqueries.\n2. **Identify the Race:** Use the races table to identify the target race by `year` and `name` (Australian Grand Prix 2008).\n3. **Find Champion's Time:** Select the `milliseconds` for the champion (positionOrder = 1) in the specific race using a subquery.\n4. **Find Last Driver's Time:**  Find the `milliseconds` for the last driver. The last driver is determined by `positionOrder = (SELECT MAX(positionOrder) ...)` within the race. Also, filter the last driver's time by `T2.milliseconds IS NOT NULL`.\n5. **Calculate Percentage Difference:** Calculate the percentage difference between the last driver's time and the champion's time.  The formula is `((T2.milliseconds - T1.milliseconds) * 1.0 / T2.milliseconds) * 100` or `((last_driver_time - champion_time) * 1.0 / last_driver_time) * 100`.\n6. **Combine Subqueries:** Use subqueries to get both the champion's time and the last driver's time, then perform the calculation in the outer query.\n7. **Correct Table Joins:** Ensure that the raceId is used for joining `races` and `results` tables. Alias the tables appropriately (e.g., `races AS R`, `results AS ResChamp`, `results AS ResLast`).\n8. **Avoid Unnecessary Joins:** The original query contained redundant joins. Remove the unnecessary `INNER JOIN races AS T3` in the main query since the `races` table is already used in the subqueries."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. Ensure the query retrieves the owner's display name from the 'users' table by joining it with the 'posts' table on the 'OwnerUserId' and 'Id' columns, instead of directly selecting 'OwnerDisplayName' from the 'posts' table, and use subquery to find the maximum viewcount.
8. Avoid joining to the `colour` table and instead directly use the `eye_colour_id` and `hair_colour_id` values in the `superhero` table, referencing the corresponding IDs for 'blue eyes' and 'brown hair' based on external knowledge or prior queries if available.
9. Ensure that the tables used in the WHERE clause conditions are linked to the SELECT columns via JOIN clauses.
10. 1. **Handle NULL `milliseconds` values:** The `milliseconds` column can contain NULL values, especially for drivers who didn't finish the race. Use `WHERE T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL AND T2.milliseconds IS NOT NULL` to exclude these rows in the subqueries.
2. **Identify the Race:** Use the races table to identify the target race by `year` and `name` (Australian Grand Prix 2008).
3. **Find Champion's Time:** Select the `milliseconds` for the champion (positionOrder = 1) in the specific race using a subquery.
4. **Find Last Driver's Time:**  Find the `milliseconds` for the last driver. The last driver is determined by `positionOrder = (SELECT MAX(positionOrder) ...)` within the race. Also, filter the last driver's time by `T2.milliseconds IS NOT NULL`.
5. **Calculate Percentage Difference:** Calculate the percentage difference between the last driver's time and the champion's time.  The formula is `((T2.milliseconds - T1.milliseconds) * 1.0 / T2.milliseconds) * 100` or `((last_driver_time - champion_time) * 1.0 / last_driver_time) * 100`.
6. **Combine Subqueries:** Use subqueries to get both the champion's time and the last driver's time, then perform the calculation in the outer query.
7. **Correct Table Joins:** Ensure that the raceId is used for joining `races` and `results` tables. Alias the tables appropriately (e.g., `races AS R`, `results AS ResChamp`, `results AS ResLast`).
8. **Avoid Unnecessary Joins:** The original query contained redundant joins. Remove the unnecessary `INNER JOIN races AS T3` in the main query since the `races` table is already used in the subqueries.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT CAST((T1.milliseconds - T2.milliseconds) AS REAL) * 100 / T1.milliseconds FROM results AS T1 INNER JOIN results AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId INNER JOIN races AS T3 ON T3.raceId = T1.raceId WHERE T3.year = 2008 AND T3.name = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND T2.positionOrder = ( SELECT MAX(positionOrder) FROM results AS T4 INNER JOIN races AS T5 ON T5.raceId = T4.raceId WHERE T5.year = 2008 AND T5.name = 'Australian Grand Prix' ) AND T1.positionOrder = 1"]

Question: 
How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix? 

Hint:
how much faster in percentage = divide(subtract(incremental time, champion time), last_driver time) * 100%; last driver finished time = incremental time + champion time; only champion's finished time is represented by 'HH:MM:SS.mmm'; finished the game refers to time is not null

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "feedback": "1. **Target the Correct Table:** The query should primarily use the `results` table, which contains the finish times and positions, joined with the `races` table to filter by race details.\n2. **Filter for the Specific Race:** Ensure the `WHERE` clause accurately filters for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix using `T3.year = 2008` and `T3.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'` on the `races` table (aliased as `T3`).\n3. **Identify Champion and Last Place Finisher:** Use subqueries to identify the `milliseconds` for both the champion (positionOrder = 1) and the last place finisher (maximum positionOrder) within the specified race.\n4. **Handle NULL milliseconds Values:** The provided query doesn't consider situations where milliseconds are NULL. Explicitly exclude results where milliseconds are NULL using `AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL` and `AND T2.milliseconds IS NOT NULL` within the subqueries used to determine champion and last position times.\n5. **Calculate Percentage Difference:** After retrieving the milliseconds for the champion and last finisher, calculate the percentage difference using the formula: `((last_place_milliseconds - champion_milliseconds) * 100.0 / last_place_milliseconds)`. Cast to REAL/FLOAT to ensure decimal result.\n6. **Consolidate Subqueries:** Use a single `FROM` clause with joins and `WHERE` conditions to select the race, champion's time (T1) and last finisher's time (T2). Use subqueries to identify the champion's `resultId` and the last finisher's `resultId`. This simplifies the query and avoids unnecessary self-joins.\n7. **Revised Structure:** The final query structure should look like this:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT CAST((T2.milliseconds - T1.milliseconds) AS REAL) * 100.0 / T2.milliseconds\n   FROM results AS T1\n   JOIN results AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId\n   JOIN races AS T3 ON T1.raceId = T3.raceId\n   WHERE T3.year = 2008\n     AND T3.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n     AND T1.positionOrder = 1 -- Champion\n     AND T2.positionOrder = (SELECT MAX(positionOrder) FROM results WHERE raceId = T1.raceId) -- Last Finisher\n     AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL AND T2.milliseconds IS NOT NULL;\n   ```\n   However, this still might return null if there isn't a last place finisher, so we will address this.\n8. **Add Handling for No Last Place:** Consider the case where a race has only one finisher. In this case T2.milliseconds will return null so make sure T2.milliseconds is not null in the WHERE statement of T2\n9. **Make champion conditional:** Add an additional parameter to the select subquery for T1.positionOrder =1\n10. **Adjusted code:**\n```sql\nSELECT CAST((T2.milliseconds - T1.milliseconds) AS REAL) * 100.0 / T2.milliseconds\nFROM results AS T1\nJOIN results AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId\nJOIN races AS T3 ON T1.raceId = T3.raceId\nWHERE T3.year = 2008\n  AND T3.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n  AND T1.positionOrder = 1\n  AND T2.positionOrder = (SELECT MAX(positionOrder) FROM results WHERE raceId = T1.raceId AND milliseconds IS NOT NULL)\n  AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL\n  AND T2.milliseconds IS NOT NULL;\n```"

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. Ensure the query retrieves the owner's display name from the 'users' table by joining it with the 'posts' table on the 'OwnerUserId' and 'Id' columns, instead of directly selecting 'OwnerDisplayName' from the 'posts' table, and use subquery to find the maximum viewcount.
8. Avoid joining to the `colour` table and instead directly use the `eye_colour_id` and `hair_colour_id` values in the `superhero` table, referencing the corresponding IDs for 'blue eyes' and 'brown hair' based on external knowledge or prior queries if available.
9. Ensure that the tables used in the WHERE clause conditions are linked to the SELECT columns via JOIN clauses.
10. 1. **Target the Correct Table:** The query should primarily use the `results` table, which contains the finish times and positions, joined with the `races` table to filter by race details.
2. **Filter for the Specific Race:** Ensure the `WHERE` clause accurately filters for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix using `T3.year = 2008` and `T3.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'` on the `races` table (aliased as `T3`).
3. **Identify Champion and Last Place Finisher:** Use subqueries to identify the `milliseconds` for both the champion (positionOrder = 1) and the last place finisher (maximum positionOrder) within the specified race.
4. **Handle NULL milliseconds Values:** The provided query doesn't consider situations where milliseconds are NULL. Explicitly exclude results where milliseconds are NULL using `AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL` and `AND T2.milliseconds IS NOT NULL` within the subqueries used to determine champion and last position times.
5. **Calculate Percentage Difference:** After retrieving the milliseconds for the champion and last finisher, calculate the percentage difference using the formula: `((last_place_milliseconds - champion_milliseconds) * 100.0 / last_place_milliseconds)`. Cast to REAL/FLOAT to ensure decimal result.
6. **Consolidate Subqueries:** Use a single `FROM` clause with joins and `WHERE` conditions to select the race, champion's time (T1) and last finisher's time (T2). Use subqueries to identify the champion's `resultId` and the last finisher's `resultId`. This simplifies the query and avoids unnecessary self-joins.
7. **Revised Structure:** The final query structure should look like this:
   ```sql
   SELECT CAST((T2.milliseconds - T1.milliseconds) AS REAL) * 100.0 / T2.milliseconds
   FROM results AS T1
   JOIN results AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId
   JOIN races AS T3 ON T1.raceId = T3.raceId
   WHERE T3.year = 2008
     AND T3.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'
     AND T1.positionOrder = 1 -- Champion
     AND T2.positionOrder = (SELECT MAX(positionOrder) FROM results WHERE raceId = T1.raceId) -- Last Finisher
     AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL AND T2.milliseconds IS NOT NULL;
   ```
   However, this still might return null if there isn't a last place finisher, so we will address this.
8. **Add Handling for No Last Place:** Consider the case where a race has only one finisher. In this case T2.milliseconds will return null so make sure T2.milliseconds is not null in the WHERE statement of T2
9. **Make champion conditional:** Add an additional parameter to the select subquery for T1.positionOrder =1
10. **Adjusted code:**
```sql
SELECT CAST((T2.milliseconds - T1.milliseconds) AS REAL) * 100.0 / T2.milliseconds
FROM results AS T1
JOIN results AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId
JOIN races AS T3 ON T1.raceId = T3.raceId
WHERE T3.year = 2008
  AND T3.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'
  AND T1.positionOrder = 1
  AND T2.positionOrder = (SELECT MAX(positionOrder) FROM results WHERE raceId = T1.raceId AND milliseconds IS NOT NULL)
  AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL
  AND T2.milliseconds IS NOT NULL;
```

Question: 
How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix? 

Hint:
how much faster in percentage = divide(subtract(incremental time, champion time), last_driver time) * 100%; last driver finished time = incremental time + champion time; only champion's finished time is represented by 'HH:MM:SS.mmm'; finished the game refers to time is not null
