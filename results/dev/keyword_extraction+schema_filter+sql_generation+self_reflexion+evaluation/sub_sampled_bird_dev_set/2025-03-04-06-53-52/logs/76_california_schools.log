This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "1. Correct the table name `frpm` to `FRPM` in the FROM clause. SQL is case-sensitive for table names in some database systems.\n2. Ensure that all column names are correctly capitalized and enclosed in backticks where necessary to match the database schema. For example, `NSLP Provision Status` should be enclosed in backticks. Double-check the case and presence of spaces in column names like `Low Grade` and `High Grade`.\n3. Verify that the values being compared against the columns are of the correct data type. Even though the database schema defines `Low Grade` and `High Grade` as TEXT, ensure the comparison values ('09' and '12') are enclosed in single quotes to represent them as strings.\n4. Confirm that the `EILCode` 'HS' correctly represents the high school level in the `schools` table. The current query assumes this is the case based on the guidance, but it's crucial to verify this assumption.\n5. After applying the above fixes, execute the query against the database to confirm that it returns the expected results and that the result set is not empty."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Correct the table name `frpm` to `FRPM` in the FROM clause. SQL is case-sensitive for table names in some database systems.
2. Ensure that all column names are correctly capitalized and enclosed in backticks where necessary to match the database schema. For example, `NSLP Provision Status` should be enclosed in backticks. Double-check the case and presence of spaces in column names like `Low Grade` and `High Grade`.
3. Verify that the values being compared against the columns are of the correct data type. Even though the database schema defines `Low Grade` and `High Grade` as TEXT, ensure the comparison values ('09' and '12') are enclosed in single quotes to represent them as strings.
4. Confirm that the `EILCode` 'HS' correctly represents the high school level in the `schools` table. The current query assumes this is the case based on the guidance, but it's crucial to verify this assumption.
5. After applying the above fixes, execute the query against the database to confirm that it returns the expected results and that the result set is not empty.

1.The erroneous SQL statement,
2.The corresponding natural language question and guidance for addressing the issue,
3.The database schema item representations,
4.The underlying cause of the SQL error.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback instructions to guide a large language model on how to refine the SQL query, ensuring it accurately aligns with the core requirements of the problem.

Input Data
###
Erroneous SQL:
SELECT
  T2.City
FROM frpm AS T1
INNER JOIN schools AS T2
  ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode
WHERE
  T1.`NSLP Provision Status` = 'Provision 2' AND T1.`Low Grade` = '09' AND T1.`High Grade` = '12' AND T2.County = 'Merced' AND T2.EILCode = 'HS';

Question:
What is the city location of the high school level school with Lunch Provision 2 whose lowest grade is 9 and the highest grade is 12 in the county of Merced?

Guidance:
High school can be represented as EILCode = 'HS'

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Correct the table name `frpm` to the correct table name which is `frpm`. The table name was misspelled in the original query.
2. Ensure that all column names used in the `WHERE` clause match the exact names and casing as defined in the `frpm` and `schools` tables. For example, verify the casing and spacing in columns like `NSLP Provision Status`, `Low Grade`, `High Grade`, and `County`. 
3. Double-check the data types of the columns used in the `WHERE` clause. If any of the columns, such as `Low Grade` or `High Grade`, are numeric, remove the single quotes around the values (e.g., change `T1.Low Grade = '09'` to `T1.Low Grade = 9`).
4. Verify if the join condition `T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode` is correct and that `CDSCode` is the correct column to use for joining `frpm` and `schools` tables based on the database schema and the relationships between the tables. 
5. Confirm that the values 'Provision 2', '09', '12', 'Merced', and 'HS' exist in the corresponding columns (`NSLP Provision Status`, `Low Grade`, `High Grade`, `County`, and `EILCode`) in the database. Case sensitivity might be an issue. If the query still returns an empty result after applying the above changes, investigate the data in these columns to identify any discrepancies.


Short-Term Memory:

Question: 
What is the city location of the high school level school with Lunch Provision 2 whose lowest grade is 9 and the highest grade is 12 in the county of Merced? 

Hint:
High school can be represented as EILCode = 'HS'

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
