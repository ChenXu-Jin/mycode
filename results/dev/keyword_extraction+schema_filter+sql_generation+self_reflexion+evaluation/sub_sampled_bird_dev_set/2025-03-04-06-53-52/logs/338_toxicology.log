You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
What is the atom ID of double bonded carbon in TR012 molecule? 

Hint:
carbon refers to element = 'c'; double bond refers to bond_type = ' = ';

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final SQL query.",
    "SQL": "Your SQL query in a single string."

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. The current query joins `atom` with `connected` and `bond` tables, but it does not ensure that the `atom_id` in `connected` is specifically the atom involved in the double bond. Also, it only considers one atom in the double bond within connected table, but double bond must connect with another atom. To fix this, modify the query as follows:

1.  Introduce a subquery or another join to find `atom_id`s (`atom_id2`) that are also connected to a double bond. This ensures that the selected `atom_id` is indeed part of a double bond.
2.  Join the `connected` table with the `bond` table to filter double bonds.
3. Filter by molecule label and element to find double bonded carbon atoms.

Here's a possible revised query structure:

```sql
SELECT T1.atom_id
FROM atom AS T1
INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id
INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id
INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id
WHERE T2.label = 'TR012'
  AND T1.element = 'c'
  AND T4.bond_type = '='
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM connected AS T5 WHERE T5.atom_id2 = T1.atom_id AND T5.bond_id IN (SELECT bond_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '='))
```

This revised query uses `EXISTS` to verify that there exists a connection to the `atom_id` with a double bond, ensuring that the selected atom is part of that bond.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.atom_id FROM atom AS T1 INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id WHERE T2.label = 'TR012' AND T1.element = 'c' AND T4.bond_type = '='"]

Question: 
What is the atom ID of double bonded carbon in TR012 molecule? 

Hint:

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. The query needs adjustment to correctly identify atoms connected by a double bond within the specified molecule. Currently, it joins `atom` with `connected` and `bond` tables, but it doesn't ensure that the connected atom is also part of the same molecule and that the bond is actually connecting the carbon atom to another atom. 

Here's how to refine the query:

1.  **Clarify the Join Condition with 'connected' Table:** The 'connected' table represents a relationship between two atoms via a bond.  The original query correctly joins `atom` (T1) to `connected` (T3) on `T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id`. We need to ensure that the bond connecting these atoms is a double bond. The current join doesn't explicitly check this condition.

2. **Join to the 'atom' table again:**  Join the 'connected' table (T3) with the 'atom' table again, aliased as T5, using `T3.atom_id2 = T5.atom_id`. This allows us to access information about the atom that T1 is connected to.

3. **Filter by Double Bond within the Molecule:** The condition `T4.bond_type = '='` is already present and correct for filtering for double bonds. Ensure that the tables are correctly joined such that this filter applies to the bond connecting T1 and T5.

4. **Ensure Connected Atom is in the Same Molecule:** Add a condition to ensure that atom T5 (the atom connected to T1) is part of the same molecule, T2. This can be achieved with `T5.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id`.

In summary, the refined query should incorporate an additional join to the `atom` table via the `connected` table and include the additional filter condition to confirm the connected atom is in the same molecule.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.atom_id FROM atom AS T1 INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id WHERE T2.label = 'TR012' AND T1.element = 'c' AND T4.bond_type = '='", "SELECT T1.atom_id FROM atom AS T1 INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id WHERE T2.label = 'TR012' AND T1.element = 'c' AND T4.bond_type = '=' AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM connected AS T5 WHERE T5.atom_id2 = T1.atom_id AND T5.bond_id IN (SELECT bond_id FROM bond WHERE bond_type = '='))", "SELECT T1.atom_id FROM atom AS T1 INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id WHERE T2.label = 'TR012' AND T1.element = 'c' AND T4.bond_type = '='"]

Question: 
What is the atom ID of double bonded carbon in TR012 molecule? 

Hint:
carbon refers to element = 'c'; double bond refers to bond_type = ' = ';

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
