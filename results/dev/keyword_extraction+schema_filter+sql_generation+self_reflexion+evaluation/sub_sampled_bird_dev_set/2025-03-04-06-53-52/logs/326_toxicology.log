Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"

You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. The current query joins `atom`, `connected`, and `bond` tables, but it doesn't explicitly link the `molecule` table to the `bond` table. To ensure that the query returns molecules containing both a Sulphur atom and a double bond, directly link the `molecule` table to the `bond` table using `molecule_id`. Also ensure the connection between atom and bond using the `connected` table is correctly expressing that the bond is connected to the sulphur atom. Modify the query as follows:

1.  Join the `molecule` table with the `bond` table on `T1.molecule_id = T4.molecule_id`.
2.  Filter `atom` table `T2` for `T2.element = 'S'` and `bond` table `T4` for `T4.bond_type = '='`.
3. Use distinct to avoid duplicate molecule_ids.

Short-Term Memory:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. The current query correctly identifies molecules containing both Sulfur atoms and double bonds. However, it doesn't explicitly link the Sulfur atom to the double bond *within* the molecule. To ensure the double bond is connected to the Sulfur atom, you need to join the `atom` and `bond` tables via the `connected` table. This table explicitly defines the connections between atoms and bonds. Add a join to the `connected` table twice, linking the `atom_id` of the Sulfur atom to `connected.atom_id` and the `bond_id` of the double bond to `connected.bond_id`. The revised query should then select the distinct `molecule_id`.

["SELECT T1.molecule_id FROM molecule AS T1 INNER JOIN atom AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T2.atom_id = T3.atom_id INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id WHERE T2.element = 'S' AND T4.bond_type = '='", "SELECT DISTINCT T1.molecule_id FROM molecule AS T1 INNER JOIN atom AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T2.atom_id = T3.atom_id INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id WHERE T2.element = 'S' AND T4.bond_type = '='", "SELECT DISTINCT T1.molecule_id FROM molecule AS T1 INNER JOIN atom AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T1.molecule_id = T4.molecule_id WHERE T2.element = 'S' AND T4.bond_type = '='"]

Question: 
Which molecule consisted of Sulphur atom with double bond? 

Hint:
sulphur refers to element - 's'; double bond refers to bond_type = ' = ';

    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for molecules containing both a Sulfur atom and a double bond. The database schema includes tables for atoms, bonds, molecules, and a table connecting atoms and bonds (connected). I need to join these tables to identify molecules that satisfy both conditions.\n\n1.  Start by joining `molecule` and `atom` on `molecule_id` to link molecules to their constituent atoms.\n2.  Filter for atoms where `element` is 'S'.\n3.  Join `molecule` and `bond` on `molecule_id` to link molecules to their bonds.\n4.  Filter for bonds where `bond_type` is '=' (double bond).\n5.  Combine the above two conditions to find molecules that contain both a Sulfur atom and a double bond.\n6.  Return distinct `molecule_id` values to avoid duplicates.\n\nUsing the CONNECTED table to relate the Sulfur atom to the double bond requires additional joins. The corrected approach involves joining `molecule`, `atom`, `connected`, and `bond` tables. The first join relates `molecule` and `atom`; the second join connects `atom` to `connected` via `atom_id`; the third join links `connected` and `bond` via `bond_id`. The query then filters for Sulfur atoms and double bonds as before.\n",
