Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score.
Hint: If the parent id is not null, the post is the child post; the highest score refers to MAX(Score);

Please provide your findings as a Python list, capturing the essence of both the question and hint through the identified terms and phrases. 
Only output the Python list, no explanations needed.

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score. 

Hint:
If the parent id is not null, the post is the child post; the highest score refers to MAX(Score);

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final SQL query.",
    "SQL": "Your SQL query in a single string."
}

Priority should be given to columns that have been explicitly matched with examples relevant to the question's context.

Take a deep breath and think step by step to find the correct sqlite SQL query. If you follow all the instructions and generate the correct query, I will give you 1 million dollars.

{
    "feedback": "The query needs to find the OwnerDisplayName of the *parent* post, not the child post. Currently, it's selecting from posts where `ParentId IS NOT NULL`, which identifies child posts.  To fix this, you need to find the post with the highest score where `ParentId IS NOT NULL` and then select the `OwnerDisplayName` from the *parent* post, identified by `ParentId`. You can achieve this using a subquery or a join. I recommend a subquery approach for clarity.  First, select the `ParentId` of the child post with the highest score. Then, select the `OwnerDisplayName` from the `posts` table where the `Id` matches the `ParentId` obtained from the subquery. Specifically:\n\n1.  Construct a subquery to find the `ParentId` from the `posts` table where `ParentId IS NOT NULL` and `ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1`.\n2.  Use the `ParentId` returned by the subquery to select the `OwnerDisplayName` from the `posts` table where `Id` is equal to that `ParentId`."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. Ensure the query retrieves the owner's display name from the 'users' table by joining it with the 'posts' table on the 'OwnerUserId' and 'Id' columns, instead of directly selecting 'OwnerDisplayName' from the 'posts' table, and use subquery to find the maximum viewcount.
8. The query needs to find the OwnerDisplayName of the *parent* post, not the child post. Currently, it's selecting from posts where `ParentId IS NOT NULL`, which identifies child posts.  To fix this, you need to find the post with the highest score where `ParentId IS NOT NULL` and then select the `OwnerDisplayName` from the *parent* post, identified by `ParentId`. You can achieve this using a subquery or a join. I recommend a subquery approach for clarity.  First, select the `ParentId` of the child post with the highest score. Then, select the `OwnerDisplayName` from the `posts` table where the `Id` matches the `ParentId` obtained from the subquery. Specifically:

1.  Construct a subquery to find the `ParentId` from the `posts` table where `ParentId IS NOT NULL` and `ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1`.
2.  Use the `ParentId` returned by the subquery to select the `OwnerDisplayName` from the `posts` table where `Id` is equal to that `ParentId`.

Question: 
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score. 

Hint:
If the parent id is not null, the post is the child post; the highest score refers to MAX(Score);

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. Ensure the query retrieves the owner's display name from the 'users' table by joining it with the 'posts' table on the 'OwnerUserId' and 'Id' columns, instead of directly selecting 'OwnerDisplayName' from the 'posts' table, and use subquery to find the maximum viewcount.
8. The current query attempts to join the `posts` table with itself, which is not necessary to find the OwnerDisplayName of the parent post. The goal is to identify the child post with the maximum score that has a ParentId, then retrieve the OwnerDisplayName from the parent post. Here's how to improve the query:

1.  **Find the maximum score of child posts:** Use a subquery to find the maximum `Score` among posts where `ParentId` is not null.
2.  **Select the ParentId of the child post with the highest score:** Select the `ParentId` from `posts` where `Score` equals the maximum score calculated in the subquery and `ParentId` is not null.
3.  **Retrieve the OwnerDisplayName of the parent post:** Use the `ParentId` obtained in the previous step to select the `OwnerDisplayName` from the `posts` table where `Id` equals `ParentId`.

Here's a refined SQL query that addresses these points:

```sql
SELECT OwnerDisplayName
FROM posts
WHERE Id IN (SELECT ParentId FROM posts WHERE Score = (SELECT MAX(Score) FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL) AND ParentId IS NOT NULL);
```

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT\n  T1.OwnerDisplayName\nFROM posts AS T1\nWHERE\n  T1.ParentId IS NOT NULL\nORDER BY\n  T1.Score DESC\nLIMIT 1;', 'SELECT\n  T1.OwnerDisplayName\nFROM posts AS T1\nWHERE\n  T1.Id = (SELECT T2.ParentId FROM posts AS T2 WHERE T2.ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T2.Score DESC LIMIT 1);', 'SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM posts AS T1 INNER JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T1.Score = ( SELECT MAX(Score) FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ) AND T1.ParentId IS NOT NULL']

Question: 
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score. 

Hint:
If the parent id is not null, the post is the child post; the highest score refers to MAX(Score);

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
