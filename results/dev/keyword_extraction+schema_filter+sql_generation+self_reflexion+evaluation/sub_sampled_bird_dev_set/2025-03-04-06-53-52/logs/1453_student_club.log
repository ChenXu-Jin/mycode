This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
List the name of events with less than average parking cost. 

Hint:
name of events refers to event_name; less than average parking cost refers to cost < DIVIDE(SUM(cost), COUNT(event_id)) where category = 'Parking'

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. Ensure the query retrieves the owner's display name from the 'users' table by joining it with the 'posts' table on the 'OwnerUserId' and 'Id' columns, instead of directly selecting 'OwnerDisplayName' from the 'posts' table, and use subquery to find the maximum viewcount.
8. Avoid joining to the `colour` table and instead directly use the `eye_colour_id` and `hair_colour_id` values in the `superhero` table, referencing the corresponding IDs for 'blue eyes' and 'brown hair' based on external knowledge or prior queries if available.
9. Ensure that the tables used in the WHERE clause conditions are linked to the SELECT columns via JOIN clauses.
10. Ensure correct aggregation and filtering within subqueries to isolate relevant data for accurate comparisons, particularly when dealing with minimum/maximum values and joining multiple tables.
11. Ensure accurate age calculation using STRFTIME for date comparisons instead of SUBSTR on potentially varying date formats.
12. The original query is overly complex and returns an empty result because of how the joins and subquery are structured. To fix this, focus on directly calculating the average parking cost and then selecting events where the associated parking expense is less than this average.

1.  **Calculate the average parking cost:** Create a subquery that calculates the average cost from the `expense` table, but only for expenses linked to budgets where the category is 'Parking'.
2.  **Join `event`, `budget`, and `expense` tables:** Join the `event`, `budget`, and `expense` tables using the appropriate `event_id` and `budget_id` foreign key relationships.
3.  **Filter by 'Parking' category:** In the main query, filter the results to include only records where the `category` in the `budget` table is 'Parking'.
4.  **Filter by cost less than average:**  Filter the results to include only events where the `cost` in the `expense` table is less than the average cost calculated in the subquery.  
5.  **Select `event_name`:** Select the `event_name` from the `event` table.

Here's how to implement these steps:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name
FROM event AS T1
INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event
INNER JOIN expense AS T3 ON T2.budget_id = T3.link_to_budget
WHERE T2.category = 'Parking'
AND T3.cost < (SELECT avg(cost) FROM expense AS T4 INNER JOIN budget AS T5 ON T4.link_to_budget = T5.budget_id WHERE T5.category = 'Parking');
```

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.event_name FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event INNER JOIN expense AS T3 ON T2.budget_id = T3.link_to_budget WHERE T2.category = 'Parking' AND T3.cost < (SELECT avg(cost) FROM expense AS T4 INNER JOIN budget AS T5 ON T4.link_to_budget = T5.budget_id WHERE T5.category = 'Parking')"]

Question: 
List the name of events with less than average parking cost. 

Hint:
name of events refers to event_name; less than average parking cost refers to cost < DIVIDE(SUM(cost), COUNT(event_id)) where category = 'Parking'

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. Ensure the query retrieves the owner's display name from the 'users' table by joining it with the 'posts' table on the 'OwnerUserId' and 'Id' columns, instead of directly selecting 'OwnerDisplayName' from the 'posts' table, and use subquery to find the maximum viewcount.
8. Avoid joining to the `colour` table and instead directly use the `eye_colour_id` and `hair_colour_id` values in the `superhero` table, referencing the corresponding IDs for 'blue eyes' and 'brown hair' based on external knowledge or prior queries if available.
9. Ensure that the tables used in the WHERE clause conditions are linked to the SELECT columns via JOIN clauses.
10. Ensure correct aggregation and filtering within subqueries to isolate relevant data for accurate comparisons, particularly when dealing with minimum/maximum values and joining multiple tables.
11. Ensure accurate age calculation using STRFTIME for date comparisons instead of SUBSTR on potentially varying date formats.
12. The provided SQL query retrieves event names where the 'Parking' budget category's expense cost is less than the average cost of all 'Parking' expenses. However, to accurately address the prompt 'List the name of events with less than average parking cost,' you need to calculate the average parking cost for each event individually and then filter the events based on this event-specific average. Here's a breakdown of the required modifications:

1. **Calculate the average parking cost per event:** Create a subquery that groups expenses by `link_to_budget`, joins with `budget` on `budget_id`, filters by `category = 'Parking'`, and calculates the average cost per event. This subquery should return the `link_to_event` and the average `cost` for each event.

2. **Join with the `event` table:** Join the result of the subquery with the `event` table on `event_id` = `link_to_event`.

3. **Filter the results:** In the outer query's `WHERE` clause, filter the results to include only events where the `cost` from the subquery is less than the average cost calculated in the subquery. This will ensure you retrieve only events with parking costs lower than average parking cost.

4. **Select the event name:** Finally, select the `event_name` from the `event` table to display the names of the events that meet the specified criteria. Wrap the entire query inside SELECT DISTINCT to avoid duplicate entries in the output.

Essentially, your FROM clause needs to derive the average expense per event category Parking, and your where clause needs to ensure that you are comparing individual event expenses with the average parking expense calculated.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.event_name FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event INNER JOIN expense AS T3 ON T2.budget_id = T3.link_to_budget WHERE T2.category = 'Parking' AND T3.cost < (SELECT avg(cost) FROM expense AS T4 INNER JOIN budget AS T5 ON T4.link_to_budget = T5.budget_id WHERE T5.category = 'Parking')", "SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event INNER JOIN expense AS T3 ON T2.budget_id = T3.link_to_budget WHERE T2.category = 'Parking' AND T3.cost < (SELECT avg(cost) FROM expense AS T4 INNER JOIN budget AS T5 ON T4.link_to_budget = T5.budget_id WHERE T5.category = 'Parking')"]

Question: 
List the name of events with less than average parking cost. 

Hint:
name of events refers to event_name; less than average parking cost refers to cost < DIVIDE(SUM(cost), COUNT(event_id)) where category = 'Parking'

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Calculate the average parking cost: SELECT avg(T1.cost) FROM expense AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.link_to_budget = T2.budget_id WHERE T2.category = 'Parking'.\n2. Select event names where the event is associated with a parking budget and the cost is less than the average: SELECT T1.event_name FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event INNER JOIN expense AS T3 ON T2.budget_id = T3.link_to_budget WHERE T2.category = 'Parking' AND T3.cost < (SELECT avg(T4.cost) FROM expense AS T4 INNER JOIN budget AS T5 ON T4.link_to_budget = T5.budget_id WHERE T5.category = 'Parking').\n3. Ensure the event names are distinct by adding DISTINCT: SELECT DISTINCT T1.event_name FROM event AS T1 INNER JOIN budget AS T2 ON T1.event_id = T2.link_to_event INNER JOIN expense AS T3 ON T2.budget_id = T3.link_to_budget WHERE T2.category = 'Parking' AND T3.cost < (SELECT avg(T4.cost) FROM expense AS T4 INNER JOIN budget AS T5 ON T4.link_to_budget = T5.budget_id WHERE T5.category = 'Parking').",
