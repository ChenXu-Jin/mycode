You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE alignment (
  id        INTEGER not null
            primary key,
  alignment TEXT default NULL
);

CREATE TABLE attribute (
  id             INTEGER not null
            primary key,
  attribute_name TEXT default NULL
);

CREATE TABLE colour (
  id     INTEGER not null
            primary key,
  colour TEXT default NULL
);

CREATE TABLE gender (
  id     INTEGER not null
            primary key,
  gender TEXT default NULL
);

CREATE TABLE publisher (
  id             INTEGER not null
            primary key,
  publisher_name TEXT default NULL
);

CREATE TABLE race (
  id   INTEGER not null
            primary key,
  race TEXT default NULL
);

CREATE TABLE superhero (
  id             INTEGER not null
            primary key,
  superhero_name TEXT default NULL,
  full_name      TEXT default NULL,
  gender_id      INTEGER          default NULL,
  eye_colour_id  INTEGER          default NULL,
  hair_colour_id INTEGER          default NULL,
  skin_colour_id INTEGER          default NULL,
  race_id        INTEGER          default NULL,
  publisher_id   INTEGER          default NULL,
  alignment_id   INTEGER          default NULL,
  height_cm      INTEGER          default NULL,
  weight_kg      INTEGER          default NULL,
  foreign key (alignment_id) references alignment(id),
  foreign key (eye_colour_id) references colour(id),
  foreign key (gender_id) references gender(id),
  foreign key (hair_colour_id) references colour(id),
  foreign key (publisher_id) references publisher(id),
  foreign key (race_id) references race(id),
  foreign key (skin_colour_id) references colour(id)
);

CREATE TABLE hero_attribute (
  hero_id         INTEGER default NULL,
  attribute_id    INTEGER default NULL,
  attribute_value INTEGER default NULL,
  foreign key (attribute_id) references attribute(id),
  foreign key (hero_id) references superhero(id)
);

CREATE TABLE superpower (
  id         INTEGER not null
            primary key,
  power_name TEXT default NULL
);

CREATE TABLE hero_power (
  hero_id  INTEGER default NULL,
  power_id INTEGER default NULL,
  foreign key (hero_id) references superhero(id),
  foreign key (power_id) references superpower(id)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Question: 
In superheroes with height between 150 to 180, what is the percentage of heroes published by Marvel Comics? 

Hint:
height between 150 to 180 refers to height_cm BETWEEN 150 AND 180; heroes published by Marvel Comics refers to publisher_id = 13; calculation = MULTIPLY(DIVIDE(SUM(publisher.id = 13)), COUNT(publisher.id), 100)

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final SQL query.",
    "SQL": "Your SQL query in a single string."
}

Priority should be given to columns that have been explicitly matched with examples relevant to the question's context.

Take a deep breath and think step by step to find the correct sqlite SQL query. If you follow all the instructions and generate the correct query, I will give you 1 million dollars.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the percentage of superheroes published by Marvel Comics, given that their height is between 150 and 180. First, I need to count the total number of superheroes whose height is between 150 and 180. Second, I need to find the number of superheroes whose height is between 150 and 180 and are published by 'Marvel Comics'. Finally, I need to divide the second number by the first number and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. The publisher id for Marvel Comics is 13.\n\nI will use a subquery to filter heroes by height and then join with the publisher table to determine if the hero is published by Marvel Comics.  I will use COUNT to count the number of such heroes and compute the percentage. Finally, I will filter out null height values.\n\nAlternative solution: Calculate the percentage directly within the query, but this makes the query a little long. I would prefer to calculate the percentage outside the query.",
