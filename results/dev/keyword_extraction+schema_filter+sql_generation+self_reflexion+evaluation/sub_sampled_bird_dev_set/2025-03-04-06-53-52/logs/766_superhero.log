);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. Ensure the query retrieves the owner's display name from the 'users' table by joining it with the 'posts' table on the 'OwnerUserId' and 'Id' columns, instead of directly selecting 'OwnerDisplayName' from the 'posts' table, and use subquery to find the maximum viewcount.
8. The current query returns the full name of a superhero who possesses the 'strength' attribute, ordered by the attribute value. However, it doesn't specifically target the superhero with the *highest* strength attribute. To find the superhero with the highest strength, you need to select the full name associated with the maximum attribute_value for 'strength'. Modify the query as follows:

1.  **Subquery to Find Max Strength:** Create a subquery that selects the maximum `attribute_value` from the `hero_attribute` table, filtered by `attribute_name = 'strength'` using joins to the `attribute` table.
2.  **Join with Superhero Table:** Join the `superhero` table with `hero_attribute` and `attribute` tables.
3.  **Filter by Max Strength:** Filter the results to only include the superhero(es) where the `attribute_value` matches the maximum strength value obtained in the subquery.
4.  **Select Full Name:** Select the `full_name` of the superhero(es).

Essentially, you need to correlate the `attribute_value` of strength to the superhero's full name and only return the full name associated with MAX(attribute_value).

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT\n  T1.full_name\nFROM superhero AS T1\nINNER JOIN hero_attribute AS T2\n  ON T1.id = T2.hero_id\nINNER JOIN attribute AS T3\n  ON T2.attribute_id = T3.id\nWHERE\n  T3.attribute_name = 'strength'\nORDER BY\n  T2.attribute_value DESC\nLIMIT 1;"]

Question: 
What is the hero's full name with the highest attribute in strength? 

Hint:
highest attribute in strength refers to MAX(attribute_value) WHERE attribute_name = 'strength';

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. Ensure the query retrieves the owner's display name from the 'users' table by joining it with the 'posts' table on the 'OwnerUserId' and 'Id' columns, instead of directly selecting 'OwnerDisplayName' from the 'posts' table, and use subquery to find the maximum viewcount.
8. The provided SQL query might return an empty result set if the maximum strength value is not uniquely associated with a single hero. To address this, modify the query to first identify the maximum strength value, then select all heroes that possess this maximum strength. This can be achieved using a subquery to find the maximum strength and then using that value in the main query's WHERE clause. Specifically, ensure that the final query returns all heroes sharing the maximal strength value instead of just one.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT\n  T1.full_name\nFROM superhero AS T1\nINNER JOIN hero_attribute AS T2\n  ON T1.id = T2.hero_id\nINNER JOIN attribute AS T3\n  ON T2.attribute_id = T3.id\nWHERE\n  T3.attribute_name = 'strength'\nORDER BY\n  T2.attribute_value DESC\nLIMIT 1;", "SELECT\n  T1.full_name\nFROM superhero AS T1\nINNER JOIN hero_attribute AS T2\n  ON T1.id = T2.hero_id\nINNER JOIN attribute AS T3\n  ON T2.attribute_id = T3.id\nWHERE\n  T3.attribute_name = 'strength' AND T2.attribute_value = (\n    SELECT\n      MAX(attribute_value)\n    FROM hero_attribute\n    WHERE\n      attribute_id = (SELECT id FROM attribute WHERE attribute_name = 'strength')\n  );"]

Question: 
What is the hero's full name with the highest attribute in strength? 

Hint:
highest attribute in strength refers to MAX(attribute_value) WHERE attribute_name = 'strength';

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
