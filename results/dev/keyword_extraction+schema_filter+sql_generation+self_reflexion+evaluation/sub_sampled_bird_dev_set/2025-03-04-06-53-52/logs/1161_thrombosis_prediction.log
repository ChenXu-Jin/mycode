Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: For in-patient age 50 and above, what is their average anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) concentration?
Hint: in-patient refers to Admission = '+'; age 50 and above refers to SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(Birthday)) >= '50'; average anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) concentration refers to AVG(aCL IgG)

Please provide your findings as a Python list, capturing the essence of both the question and hint through the identified terms and phrases.

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Consider case-insensitive matching for string comparisons in the WHERE clause, especially when dealing with elements or other text-based attributes.
7. Ensure the query retrieves the owner's display name from the 'users' table by joining it with the 'posts' table on the 'OwnerUserId' and 'Id' columns, instead of directly selecting 'OwnerDisplayName' from the 'posts' table, and use subquery to find the maximum viewcount.
8. Avoid joining to the `colour` table and instead directly use the `eye_colour_id` and `hair_colour_id` values in the `superhero` table, referencing the corresponding IDs for 'blue eyes' and 'brown hair' based on external knowledge or prior queries if available.
9. Ensure that the tables used in the WHERE clause conditions are linked to the SELECT columns via JOIN clauses.
10. Ensure correct aggregation and filtering within subqueries to isolate relevant data for accurate comparisons, particularly when dealing with minimum/maximum values and joining multiple tables.
11. The SQL query incorrectly calculates age. Instead of subtracting substrings of the year, use the `STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', Birthday)` function to get the age directly. Also, ensure the age comparison is correct by using '>=' instead of '<='. The query should be rewritten as follows: SELECT avg(T1.`aCL IgG`) FROM Examination AS T1 INNER JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.Admission = '+' AND STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', T2.Birthday) >= 50;

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT avg(T1.`aCL IgG`) FROM Examination AS T1 INNER JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.Admission = '+' AND SUBSTR(T2.Birthday, 1, 4) <= SUBSTR(date('now'), 1, 4) - 50"]

Question: 
For in-patient age 50 and above, what is their average anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) concentration? 

Hint:
in-patient refers to Admission = '+'; age 50 and above refers to SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(Birthday)) >= '50'; average anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) concentration refers to AVG(aCL IgG)

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Question:
For in-patient age 50 and above, what is their average anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) concentration?

Incorrect SQL:
SELECT avg(T1.`aCL IgG`) FROM Examination AS T1 INNER JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.Admission = '+' AND SUBSTR(T2.Birthday, 1, 4) <= SUBSTR(date('now'), 1, 4) - 50

Correct SQL:
SELECT avg(T1.`aCL IgG`) FROM Examination AS T1 INNER JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.Admission = '+' AND STRFTIME('%Y', 'now') - STRFTIME('%Y', T2.Birthday) >= 50
