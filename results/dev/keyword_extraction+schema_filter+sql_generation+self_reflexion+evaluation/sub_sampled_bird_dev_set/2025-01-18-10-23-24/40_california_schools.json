This will be done by filtering the 'schools' table based on the district name 'Fresno Unified'. Next, I will need to retrieve the average reading scores from the 'satscores' table, joining it with the 'schools' table using the common 'CDSCode'. I will filter these records to calculate the lowest average score in reading. Since I want the telephone number of the corresponding school, I\u2019ll select the phone number from the 'schools' table. I will use ORDER BY to sort based on the average reading scores and LIMIT 1 to retrieve only the school with the lowest score. This logic aligns with the provided guidelines to ensure that I select only the necessary columns and avoid any unnecessary data in my output.",
