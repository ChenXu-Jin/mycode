After obtaining the atom IDs, I will then join the 'atom' table to get the corresponding elements of those atoms. This involves using appropriate table aliases for clarity. I will select only the 'element' column from the 'atom' table to meet the output criteria specified in the instructions. The process will ensure that all relevant relationships and constraints are respected, and only the required information is obtained.",
