We can join the 'atom' and 'bond' tables through the 'connected' table since it contains the relationships between atoms and bonds. The relevant columns we need to select based on the question are 'element' from the 'atom' table and 'bond_type' from the 'bond' table. We can filter our query based on the 'molecule_id' column in the 'atom' and 'bond' tables to ensure that we only retrieve data related to the molecule with ID 'TR016'. Therefore, our query will include INNER JOINs to link the tables where the conditions are met.",
