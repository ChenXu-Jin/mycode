The hint provides the condition that we should search for blue eyes in the 'colour' table, specifically where 'colour' is 'Blue'. This then relates to the 'superhero' table via the 'eye_colour_id' foreign key, which connects to the 'colour' table's 'id'. I will use this relationship to filter superheroes and select their full names. Additionally, since the question asks for at least five full names, I will limit the results to five by using 'LIMIT 5'. Therefore, the final SQL query will have a JOIN clause between 'superhero' and 'colour' tables, where filtering is applied based on the eye colour being 'Blue'.",
