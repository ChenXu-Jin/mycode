First, join the relevant tables: molecule, bond, and connected. 2. Filter the results to only include the molecule with label 'TR006'. 3. Count the number of bonds of type ' = ' (which represent double bonds) for that specific molecule. 4. Additionally, I need to check the label of the molecule to determine carcinogenic status. The label being '+' means it is carcinogenic, while '-' means it is not. 5. In the final SELECT clause, I will only return the count of double bonds and the carcinogenic status without any unnecessary columns.",
