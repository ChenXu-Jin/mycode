The question specifies that we are looking for accounts with approved loans from 1997, which means I need to filter the 'loan' table by the date. Furthermore, I need to identify the account associated with the lowest loan amount among those that fit the criteria. The hint regarding 'weekly issuance statement' (POPLATEK TYDNE) indicates that I should filter accounts that have a frequency of 'POPLATEK TYDNE'. I will join the 'loan' and 'account' tables on 'account_id', then filter for loans with an 'approved' status in '1997', select the accounts' details, and sort by amount in ascending order, limiting the results to the lowest one. Finally, I will select only the 'account_id' to adhere to the instructions provided.",
