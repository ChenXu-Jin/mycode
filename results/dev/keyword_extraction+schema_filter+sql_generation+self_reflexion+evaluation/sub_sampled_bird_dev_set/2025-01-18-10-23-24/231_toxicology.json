I'll filter the rows for the specific molecule (TR018) and then group by 'bond_type' to count how many of each bond type exists. To find the majority, I can use the ORDER BY clause on COUNT(bond_type) and limit the results to 1 to get the bond type with the highest count. Additionally, since I need to determine if the molecule TR018 is carcinogenic, I will also select the 'label' column from the 'molecule' table, which indicates whether the molecule is carcinogenic ('+' for carcinogenic and '-' for non-carcinogenic). Finally, I will ensure to output only the relevant columns: the majority bond type and the label indicating carcinogenicity.",
