The 'results' table connects drivers to the races they participated in. First, I will determine the raceId for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix using filters on the year and location.

The SQL query will focus on counting the distinct driverIds from the results table for the specified raceId, ensuring the nationality filter is applied.",
