Since specific counties or districts are not directly mentioned in the schema, I'll assume that Riverside is represented within the 'County' and 'District' attributes, likely as 'Riverside County' or a similarly named entry. I will filter the schools based on this county name. Next, I will select the funding type from the 'schools' table while ensuring that the join is correctly set up between 'satscores' and 'schools' tables using the 'cds' foreign key. Finally, I will apply a HAVING clause to filter the results only to those schools with an average math score above 400. I will add an ORDER BY clause for organization but will not include it in the final SELECT output as per the instructions.",
