This requires accessing both the event and expense tables. I will calculate the average parking cost by summing the costs of expenses where the category is 'Parking' and dividing it by the count of those expenses. Then I must filter the events based on whether their associated expense cost is less than this average. I will need to join the expense table with the event table through the budget they are connected to, as expenses link to budgets, which in turn link to events. Finally, I will select the event_name of those that meet the criteria. Since I only need the event names, I will only include that column in the SELECT clause.",
