According to the provided schema, eye colour, hair colour, and skin colour are represented by 'eye_colour_id', 'hair_colour_id', and 'skin_colour_id' columns from the 'superhero' table respectively. The gender is specified in the 'gender' table, so we will need to join it with the 'superhero' table using the foreign key 'gender_id'. To filter superheroes published by Dark Horse Comics, we will also join the 'publisher' table with the 'superhero' table using the 'publisher_id'. Lastly, we will retrieve only the required columns. The logic can be summarized as follows: join the relevant tables, filter by gender and publisher, and select the appropriate colour columns.",
