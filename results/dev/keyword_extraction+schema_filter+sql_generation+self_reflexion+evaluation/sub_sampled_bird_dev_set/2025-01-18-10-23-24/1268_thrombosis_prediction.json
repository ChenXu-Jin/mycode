According to the provided schema, abnormal values for anti-SM are represented in the 'SM' column with values not equal to '-' and '+-'. Next, since the question asks for the youngest patients, I need to sort the results by the 'Birthday' column to get the three youngest patients. Additionally, I will include only the IDs of these patients in the selection. Because I need to select from two tables (Patient and Laboratory), I will join them on the Patient ID, and I'll ensure to filter out any NULL values in the SM column during my query. Finally, I will limit the result to 3 to get only the three youngest patients. The query follows closely the outlined steps to ensure accuracy and compliance with the provided instructions.",
