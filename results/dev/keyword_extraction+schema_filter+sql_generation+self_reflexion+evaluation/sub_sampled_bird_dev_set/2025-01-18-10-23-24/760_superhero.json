Next, I will calculate the total number of these filtered superheroes and then the number of those that are published by Marvel, which corresponds to 'publisher_id = 13'. The formula for percentage is (number of Marvel superheroes / total number of superheroes) * 100. I can achieve this by using the COUNT function along with a filtered SUM for the Marvel superheroes.
