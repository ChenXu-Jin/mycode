First, I need to identify the atom with element 's' (Sulphur) from the 'atom' table. Next, I need to find any bonds that correspond to this atom, specifically looking for bonds of type ' = ' (double bond) from the 'bond' table. Subsequently, I will link the bonds back to the molecule they belong to. This requires joining the 'atom', 'connected', and 'bond' tables together, focusing on the relevant columns. Finally, I will select the 'molecule_id' from the 'molecule' table based on the filters I've applied to get the final output.",
