The condition of 'abnormal anti-SSA' is specified as SSA NOT IN ('-', '+-'). First, I need to join the Patient and Laboratory tables to filter patients based on this condition. Then, I will find the minimum 'First Date' from the Patient table while ensuring that the anti-SSA results are abnormal. The output should only include the patient's ID and should return only one result \u2014 the first patient according to 'First Date'. Therefore, I will use ORDER BY to sort the results by 'First Date' and LIMIT 1 to get the first patient.",
