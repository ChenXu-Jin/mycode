I will need to join the superhero table with the race table to filter out human superheroes and also join the colour table to get the hair colour based on the `hair_colour_id`. First, I will filter for `height_cm = 185` in the superhero table and check the race for humans in the race table. After obtaining the appropriate ID for the hair colour, I will select the hair colour from the colour table. Since the question specifies we only need the hair colour, I will return just that in the SELECT clause.",
