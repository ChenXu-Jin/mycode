To calculate the price per unit, I will divide the Price by Amount from the transactions_1k table. Then, I will filter the transactions where the ProductID is 5 and the calculated price per unit is greater than 29.00. After determining which customers meet this criterion, I need to check their consumption status in August 2012, which is indicated by the 'Date' field in the yearmonth table containing '201208'. To accomplish this, I will join the 'transactions_1k' table with the 'yearmonth' table through the CustomerID, and filter the records based on the specified date.
