To do this, I will join the 'sets' table and the 'set_translations' table. For sets with Korean translations, I will filter for language = 'Korean'. For sets without Japanese translations, I will filter out any sets where the language is 'Japanese'. The final output should only include the 'name' of the sets, aligning with the request for 'names of sets'. To accomplish this, I will use a LEFT JOIN to include all sets and their translations, then filter for the desired languages in the WHERE clause.
