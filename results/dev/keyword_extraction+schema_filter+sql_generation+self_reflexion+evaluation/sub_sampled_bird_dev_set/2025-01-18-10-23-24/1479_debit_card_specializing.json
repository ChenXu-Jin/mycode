Identify the relevant tables: 'yearmonth' for consumption data and 'customers' for currency information. 2. Join the 'yearmonth' table with the 'customers' table to filter by the currency 'CZK'. 3. Extract the year from the 'Date' column in the 'yearmonth' table. Since the first four characters of the date represent the year, we can use substring functions to achieve this. 4. Aggregate the consumption data by year and find the year with the maximum total consumption. 5. Construct the SQL query while adhering to the database admin instructions.",
