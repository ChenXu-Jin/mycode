This requires me to query the 'drivers' table to filter by the birth year (dob) equal to 1971. Additionally, I need to check the 'results' table to find out if they have a fastest lap time recorded, as indicated by the 'fastestLapTime' column in the 'results' table. The necessary fields according to the requirements are the driver's `id` and `code`. I will perform a join between the 'drivers' table and the 'results' table on the common driver IDs to filter down to those who meet both criteria. The final output will only include the `driverId` and `code` of drivers who meet these criteria.",
