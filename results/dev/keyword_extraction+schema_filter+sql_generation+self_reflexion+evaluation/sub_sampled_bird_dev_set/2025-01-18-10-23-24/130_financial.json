Identify the district_id(s) for South Bohemia from the district table using the A3 column. 2. Find all account holders related to these district_id(s) from the account table. 3. Check which of these account holders do not have a corresponding entry in the card table. 4. Lastly, count the number of these account holders. The final SQL query will join the account and district tables to filter by South Bohemia and then left join on the card table to find those without cards. I will count the distinct account_id from the account table, filtering in on district_id corresponding to South Bohemia, and conditionally checking against card ownership.",
