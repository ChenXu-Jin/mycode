This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query to correctly answer the question, follow these steps: 1. Ensure you are filtering on the actual salary data for male customers in the relevant region. This likely requires checking if there is a specific salary table or column in the client table that captures individual salaries. 2. If there is no direct 'average salary' column, you need to calculate the average salary of male clients. This can typically be done using a GROUP BY clause combined with a HAVING clause to filter out those under the 8000 threshold. 3. Modify the expected SQL to include a GROUP BY statement on client attributes (client_id) to calculate the average salary. Use a subquery to first compute the average salary and only count those who meet the average criteria. 4. The revised SQL could look something like this: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_salary FROM client WHERE gender = 'M' AND district_id IN (SELECT district_id FROM district WHERE A3 = 'North Bohemia') GROUP BY client_id HAVING avg_salary > 8000) as filtered_clients;"

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to correctly answer the question, follow these steps: 1. Ensure you are filtering on the actual salary data for male customers in the relevant region. This likely requires checking if there is a specific salary table or column in the client table that captures individual salaries. 2. If there is no direct 'average salary' column, you need to calculate the average salary of male clients. This can typically be done using a GROUP BY clause combined with a HAVING clause to filter out those under the 8000 threshold. 3. Modify the expected SQL to include a GROUP BY statement on client attributes (client_id) to calculate the average salary. Use a subquery to first compute the average salary and only count those who meet the average criteria. 4. The revised SQL could look something like this: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_salary FROM client WHERE gender = 'M' AND district_id IN (SELECT district_id FROM district WHERE A3 = 'North Bohemia') GROUP BY client_id HAVING avg_salary > 8000) as filtered_clients;

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to correctly answer the question, follow these steps: 1. Ensure you are filtering on the actual salary data for male customers in the relevant region. This likely requires checking if there is a specific salary table or column in the client table that captures individual salaries. 2. If there is no direct 'average salary' column, you need to calculate the average salary of male clients. This can typically be done using a GROUP BY clause combined with a HAVING clause to filter out those under the 8000 threshold. 3. Modify the expected SQL to include a GROUP BY statement on client attributes (client_id) to calculate the average salary. Use a subquery to first compute the average salary and only count those who meet the average criteria. 4. The revised SQL could look something like this: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_salary FROM client WHERE gender = 'M' AND district_id IN (SELECT district_id FROM district WHERE A3 = 'North Bohemia') GROUP BY client_id HAVING avg_salary > 8000) as filtered_clients;
7. 1. Verify the schema: Ensure that A11 indeed represents average salary in your database. If it does not, identify the correct column that represents the average salary in your clients or salary table. 
2. Revise the salary condition: Instead of 'T2.A11 > 8000', use the correct column name related to average salary. For example, if average salary is stored in a 'salary' table, you may need to join with that table to obtain this data. 
3. Ensure aggregation criteria: If average salary is computed over multiple entries per client, ensure you use the appropriate aggregation function (like AVG) in your SQL. Consider grouping by client ID before counting. 
4. Update the SQL: Modify the query to incorporate these changes. If you need to compute average salary from multiple records, it might look similar to: 'SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.client_id) FROM client T1 JOIN district T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id JOIN salaries S ON S.client_id = T1.client_id WHERE T1.gender = 'M' AND T2.A3 = 'North Bohemia' GROUP BY T1.client_id HAVING AVG(S.salary) > 8000'. 
5. Test the query with provided sample data to validate that the logic is now correctly capturing the intended requirements.

Question: 
How many male customers who are living in North Bohemia have average salary greater than 8000? 

Hint:
Male means that gender = 'M'; A3 refers to region; A11 pertains to average salary.

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to correctly answer the question, follow these steps: 1. Ensure you are filtering on the actual salary data for male customers in the relevant region. This likely requires checking if there is a specific salary table or column in the client table that captures individual salaries. 2. If there is no direct 'average salary' column, you need to calculate the average salary of male clients. This can typically be done using a GROUP BY clause combined with a HAVING clause to filter out those under the 8000 threshold. 3. Modify the expected SQL to include a GROUP BY statement on client attributes (client_id) to calculate the average salary. Use a subquery to first compute the average salary and only count those who meet the average criteria. 4. The revised SQL could look something like this: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_salary FROM client WHERE gender = 'M' AND district_id IN (SELECT district_id FROM district WHERE A3 = 'North Bohemia') GROUP BY client_id HAVING avg_salary > 8000) as filtered_clients;
7. 1. Verify the schema: Ensure that A11 indeed represents average salary in your database. If it does not, identify the correct column that represents the average salary in your clients or salary table. 
2. Revise the salary condition: Instead of 'T2.A11 > 8000', use the correct column name related to average salary. For example, if average salary is stored in a 'salary' table, you may need to join with that table to obtain this data. 
3. Ensure aggregation criteria: If average salary is computed over multiple entries per client, ensure you use the appropriate aggregation function (like AVG) in your SQL. Consider grouping by client ID before counting. 
4. Update the SQL: Modify the query to incorporate these changes. If you need to compute average salary from multiple records, it might look similar to: 'SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.client_id) FROM client T1 JOIN district T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id JOIN salaries S ON S.client_id = T1.client_id WHERE T1.gender = 'M' AND T2.A3 = 'North Bohemia' GROUP BY T1.client_id HAVING AVG(S.salary) > 8000'. 
5. Test the query with provided sample data to validate that the logic is now correctly capturing the intended requirements.
8. ['1. Change the SQL query to accurately aggregate client salaries by using an appropriate GROUP BY clause. Instead of applying the average salary filter at the district level, calculate the average salary for each client by using an AVG function.', "2. Ensure the AVG function is applied to the salary column in the 'client' table, which presumably contains individual salaries. This way, you can correctly determine which clients have an average salary greater than 8000.", '3. After calculating the average salary, apply the HAVING clause to filter these results based on the condition of the average salary being greater than 8000.', "4. The JOIN condition should still ensure you are linking the client records to the correct districts, so maintain the JOIN with the 'district' table based on district_id.", '5. The final SQL query should return the correct count of distinct male clients who meet all specified conditions.', "Example modified SQL query structure:\n\nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T1.client_id) \nFROM client T1 \nJOIN district T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id \nWHERE T1.gender = 'M' \nAND T2.A3 = 'North Bohemia' \nGROUP BY T1.client_id \nHAVING AVG(T1.salary) > 8000;"]

Question: 
How many male customers who are living in North Bohemia have average salary greater than 8000? 

Hint:
Male means that gender = 'M'; A3 refers to region; A11 pertains to average salary.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To answer the question of how many male customers living in North Bohemia have an average salary greater than 8000, I need to follow several steps based on the given schema and the filtering criteria specified in the question. First, I note that I need to filter clients by gender, specifically those with `gender = 'M'`. Additionally, I must filter clients based on their location, specifically `district` where `A3 = 'North Bohemia'`. I will use a JOIN between the `client` and `district` tables to achieve this, on `district_id`. According to the schema provided, `A11` represents the average salary of clients, and the question specifies that we want those with salaries exceeding 8000. Therefore, I will apply a HAVING clause to filter this criterion after grouping by `client_id`. Lastly, I will utilize COUNT to ensure I only get distinct `client_id`s that meet these criteria, thus giving the correct number of unique male clients fitting this profile. The SQL query will be structured, making sure to use table aliases for clarity and efficiency.",
