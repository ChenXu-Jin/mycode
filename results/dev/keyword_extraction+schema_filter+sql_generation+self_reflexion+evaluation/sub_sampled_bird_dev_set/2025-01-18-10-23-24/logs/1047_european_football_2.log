This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent regarding 'Francois Affolter's header's finishing rate' on '18/09/2014', follow these steps: 1. Replace 'heading_accuracy' with the correct attribute that corresponds to 'finishing rate' if available in the Player_Attributes table. Confirm if there is a specific column that denotes the finishing rate. 2. Ensure that the date format is consistent with the SQL syntax; however, since standard SQL uses 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, it is acceptable as is, but it's important to clarify that it is based on actual data stored in the database. 3. Review the database schema to make sure the Player_Attributes table includes an entry for the desired finishing rate for the specified date. If 'finishing_rate' needs to be derived differently, adjust accordingly. 4. The revised SQL query should look something like this: 'SELECT T2.finishing_rate FROM Player AS T1 JOIN Player_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T1.player_name = 'Francois Affolter' AND T2.date = '2014-09-18';' Make sure to replace 'finishing_rate' with the actual column name if it is different."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent regarding 'Francois Affolter's header's finishing rate' on '18/09/2014', follow these steps: 1. Replace 'heading_accuracy' with the correct attribute that corresponds to 'finishing rate' if available in the Player_Attributes table. Confirm if there is a specific column that denotes the finishing rate. 2. Ensure that the date format is consistent with the SQL syntax; however, since standard SQL uses 'YYYY-MM-DD' format, it is acceptable as is, but it's important to clarify that it is based on actual data stored in the database. 3. Review the database schema to make sure the Player_Attributes table includes an entry for the desired finishing rate for the specified date. If 'finishing_rate' needs to be derived differently, adjust accordingly. 4. The revised SQL query should look something like this: 'SELECT T2.finishing_rate FROM Player AS T1 JOIN Player_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T1.player_name = 'Francois Affolter' AND T2.date = '2014-09-18';' Make sure to replace 'finishing_rate' with the actual column name if it is different.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "I first analyzed the question, which asks for the heading accuracy of the football player Francois Affolter on a specific date (18/09/2014). The SQL query attempts to retrieve this information by selecting the 'heading_accuracy' attribute from the 'Player_Attributes' table where the player's name matches 'Francois Affolter' and the date matches '2014-09-18 00:00:00'. The join between 'Player' and 'Player_Attributes' is correct as it links player details to their attributes. Furthermore, the date format in the query correctly corresponds to the date format found in the database. Therefore, assuming the needed data is present in the database for the player on that date, the SQL query would indeed yield the correct 'heading_accuracy' for Francois Affolter.
