This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
What is the detailed content of the comment of the post which was created on 7/19/2010 7:37:33 PM?

SQL Query:
SELECT C.Text FROM posts AS P JOIN comments AS C ON P.Id = C.PostId WHERE P.CreaionDate = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'

Database Content:
{'badges': ['Id', 'UserId', 'Name', 'Date'], 'comments': ['Id', 'PostId', 'Score', 'Text', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postHistory': ['Id', 'PostHistoryTypeId', 'PostId', 'RevisionGUID', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'Text', 'Comment', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postLinks': ['Id', 'CreationDate', 'PostId', 'RelatedPostId', 'LinkTypeId'], 'posts': ['Id', 'PostTypeId', 'AcceptedAnswerId', 'CreaionDate', 'Score', 'ViewCount', 'Body', 'OwnerUserId', 'LasActivityDate', 'Title', 'Tags', 'AnswerCount', 'CommentCount', 'FavoriteCount', 'LastEditorUserId', 'LastEditDate', 'CommunityOwnedDate', 'ParentId', 'ClosedDate', 'OwnerDisplayName', 'LastEditorDisplayName'], 'tags': ['Id', 'TagName', 'Count', 'ExcerptPostId', 'WikiPostId'], 'users': ['Id', 'Reputation', 'CreationDate', 'DisplayName', 'LastAccessDate', 'WebsiteUrl', 'Location', 'AboutMe', 'Views', 'UpVotes', 'DownVotes', 'AccountId', 'Age', 'ProfileImageUrl'], 'votes': ['Id', 'PostId', 'VoteTypeId', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'BountyAmount']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

It uses 'P.CreaionDate' instead of the correct column 'P.CreationDate'; this is a typographical error in the column name. As a result, the query will likely fail or return no results since it doesn't reference the correct column.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
What is the detailed content of the comment of the post which was created on 7/19/2010 7:37:33 PM?

Predicted SQL:
SELECT C.Text FROM posts AS P JOIN comments AS C ON P.Id = C.PostId WHERE P.CreaionDate = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'

Execution Result:
None

Evaluation Result:

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "1. Fix the Typographical Error: Correct the column name 'P.CreaionDate' to 'P.CreationDate' in the SQL query. This is crucial for the query to reference the correct column containing the post creation date. \n\n2. Ensure Correct Timestamp Formatting: Verify that the date format consistency in the WHERE clause matches the format used in the database, which seems to be correct here as '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'. \n\n3. Modify the Query to Use a More Dynamic Time Condition: If necessary, you may want to consider using a range for the date and time, especially if the time precision is relevant (e.g., checking for records within the exact timestamp). This can ensure you capture comments for posts created at that specific time. Example: 'WHERE P.CreationDate BETWEEN '2010-07-19 19:37:33' AND '2010-07-19 19:37:33.999999'. \n\n4. Validate the Joins: Ensure that the join between the posts and comments tables is correctly aligned with existing relationships and constraints to confirm there are no additional filtering criteria which might exclude valid results. If necessary, you can add additional filtering based on the post ID if it is known to be unique. \n\n5. Execute and Test: After making the above corrections, run the updated query to check for results and verify that the returned comments text meets the question requirements."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Fix the Typographical Error: Correct the column name 'P.CreaionDate' to 'P.CreationDate' in the SQL query. This is crucial for the query to reference the correct column containing the post creation date. 

2. Ensure Correct Timestamp Formatting: Verify that the date format consistency in the WHERE clause matches the format used in the database, which seems to be correct here as '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'. 

3. Modify the Query to Use a More Dynamic Time Condition: If necessary, you may want to consider using a range for the date and time, especially if the time precision is relevant (e.g., checking for records within the exact timestamp). This can ensure you capture comments for posts created at that specific time. Example: 'WHERE P.CreationDate BETWEEN '2010-07-19 19:37:33' AND '2010-07-19 19:37:33.999999'. 

4. Validate the Joins: Ensure that the join between the posts and comments tables is correctly aligned with existing relationships and constraints to confirm there are no additional filtering criteria which might exclude valid results. If necessary, you can add additional filtering based on the post ID if it is known to be unique. 

5. Execute and Test: After making the above corrections, run the updated query to check for results and verify that the returned comments text meets the question requirements.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
[{'chain_of_thought': "To answer the question, I need to find the comment associated with the post that was created on the specified date and time (7/19/2010 7:37:33 PM). First, I will identify the relevant tables and their connections. The 'posts' table contains the creation date and the 'comments' table holds the detailed comment text. I should first filter the 'posts' table to find the post created at the specified date and then join that result with the 'comments' table to retrieve the associated comment text. Based on the provided schema and the hints, I will use the correct column names for filtering and selecting. Thus, the SQL query selects the 'Text' column from the 'comments' table after filtering for the post creation date from the 'posts' table.", 'SQL': "SELECT C.Text FROM posts AS P JOIN comments AS C ON P.Id = C.PostId WHERE P.CreaionDate = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'"}, "SELECT C.Text FROM posts AS P JOIN comments AS C ON P.Id = C.PostId WHERE P.CreaionDate = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'"]

Question: 
What is the detailed content of the comment of the post which was created on 7/19/2010 7:37:33 PM? 

Hint:
detailed content of the comment refers to Text; created on 7/19/2010 7:37:33 PM CreationDate = 2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
