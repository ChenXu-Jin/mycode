This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Input Data

Question:
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats?

SQL Query:
SELECT MIN(T1.originalReleaseDate), T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.rarity = 'mythic' AND T2.status = 'legal';

Database Content:
{'cards': ['id', 'artist', 'asciiName', 'availability', 'borderColor', 'cardKingdomFoilId', 'cardKingdomId', 'colorIdentity', 'colorIndicator', 'colors', 'convertedManaCost', 'duelDeck', 'edhrecRank', 'faceConvertedManaCost', 'faceName', 'flavorName', 'flavorText', 'frameEffects', 'frameVersion', 'hand', 'hasAlternativeDeckLimit', 'hasContentWarning', 'hasFoil', 'hasNonFoil', 'isAlternative', 'isFullArt', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isOversized', 'isPromo', 'isReprint', 'isReserved', 'isStarter', 'isStorySpotlight', 'isTextless', 'isTimeshifted', 'keywords', 'layout', 'leadershipSkills', 'life', 'loyalty', 'manaCost', 'mcmId', 'mcmMetaId', 'mtgArenaId', 'mtgjsonV4Id', 'mtgoFoilId', 'mtgoId', 'multiverseId', 'name', 'number', 'originalReleaseDate', 'originalText', 'originalType', 'otherFaceIds', 'power', 'printings', 'promoTypes', 'purchaseUrls', 'rarity', 'scryfallId', 'scryfallIllustrationId', 'scryfallOracleId', 'setCode', 'side', 'subtypes', 'supertypes', 'tcgplayerProductId', 'text', 'toughness', 'type', 'types', 'uuid', 'variations', 'watermark'], 'foreign_data': ['id', 'flavorText', 'language', 'multiverseid', 'name', 'text', 'type', 'uuid'], 'legalities': ['id', 'format', 'status', 'uuid', 'statu'], 'sets': ['id', 'baseSetSize', 'block', 'booster', 'code', 'isFoilOnly', 'isForeignOnly', 'isNonFoilOnly', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isPartialPreview', 'keyruneCode', 'mcmId', 'mcmIdExtras', 'mcmName', 'mtgoCode', 'name', 'parentCode', 'releaseDate', 'tcgplayerGroupId', 'totalSetSize', 'type'], 'set_translations': ['id', 'language', 'setCode', 'translation'], 'rulings': ['id', 'date', 'text', 'uuid']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

The SQL query attempts to provide this by selecting the minimum release date and joining the 'cards' and 'legalities' tables based on 'uuid'.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats?

Predicted SQL:
SELECT MIN(T1.originalReleaseDate), T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.rarity = 'mythic' AND T2.status = 'legal';

Execution Result:
(None, None)

Evaluation Result:

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Replace the MIN aggregate function with a subquery that finds the UUID of the oldest mythic card based on the originalReleaseDate. You can use a CTE (Common Table Expression) or a nested SELECT for this. 2. Join the result of that subquery with the legalities table to retrieve all legal formats associated with that mythic card. 3. Ensure you select the appropriate columns: the release date and the associated legal formats. 4. You may want to use DISTINCT to eliminate duplicate legal formats if necessary. The modified structure of the query could look something like this: SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1) AND T2.status = 'legal'; This approach ensures that you correctly capture the legal formats for the oldest mythic card without grouping issues."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Replace the MIN aggregate function with a subquery that finds the UUID of the oldest mythic card based on the originalReleaseDate. You can use a CTE (Common Table Expression) or a nested SELECT for this. 2. Join the result of that subquery with the legalities table to retrieve all legal formats associated with that mythic card. 3. Ensure you select the appropriate columns: the release date and the associated legal formats. 4. You may want to use DISTINCT to eliminate duplicate legal formats if necessary. The modified structure of the query could look something like this: SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1) AND T2.status = 'legal'; This approach ensures that you correctly capture the legal formats for the oldest mythic card without grouping issues.

Input Data

Question:
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats?

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1);

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Replace the MIN aggregate function with a subquery that finds the UUID of the oldest mythic card based on the originalReleaseDate. You can use a CTE (Common Table Expression) or a nested SELECT for this. 2. Join the result of that subquery with the legalities table to retrieve all legal formats associated with that mythic card. 3. Ensure you select the appropriate columns: the release date and the associated legal formats. 4. You may want to use DISTINCT to eliminate duplicate legal formats if necessary. The modified structure of the query could look something like this: SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1) AND T2.status = 'legal'; This approach ensures that you correctly capture the legal formats for the oldest mythic card without grouping issues.
7. 1. Change the subquery that selects the uuid of the oldest mythic card to ensure it retrieves one card without any filtering by legality. This way, it will find the oldest mythic card regardless of its current legal status. 

2. Modify the join condition so that it pulls all legalities associated with the mythic card, not just those that are currently 'legal'. This can be done by removing the filter 'AND T2.status = 'legal''. 

3. Ensure that the SELECT statement returns both the 'originalReleaseDate' and other relevant formats even if they are not currently legal, reflecting any past legality as well. 

The modified SQL query would look something like this:

SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format 
FROM cards T1 
JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid 
WHERE T1.rarity = 'mythic' 
ORDER BY T1.originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1;
8. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of finding the oldest mythic card's release date along with its legal play formats, follow these steps: 1. Remove the limiting condition in the WHERE clause of the main query that restricts results to a single UUID; instead, use a subquery to first identify the oldest mythic card's UUID. 2. Utilize a JOIN based on the identified UUID to the legalities table to ensure you fetch all formats associated with that card. 3. Ensure to group the results if necessary, or simply select distinct rows to capture all legal formats for the identified card. The revised SQL query may look like: 

SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1) GROUP BY T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format;

["SELECT MIN(T1.originalReleaseDate), T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.rarity = 'mythic' AND T2.status = 'legal';", "SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1) AND T2.status = 'legal';", "SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1) AND T2.status = 'legal';", "SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1);", "SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.uuid = (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1);"]

Question: 
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats? 

Hint:
the oldest card refers to MIN(originalReleaseDate); mythic card refers to rarity = 'mythic'; legal play refers to status = 'legal'; play format refers to format

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
