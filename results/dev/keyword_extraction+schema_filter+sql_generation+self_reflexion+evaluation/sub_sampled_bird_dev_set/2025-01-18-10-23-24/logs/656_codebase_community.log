Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score. 

Hint:
If the parent id is not null, the post is the child post; the highest score refers to MAX(Score);

Then, modify the existing JOIN query to include a condition that ties this child post's ID to the parent post by matching it in the ON clause. 3.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of describing the display name of the parent ID for the child post with the highest score, follow these steps: 1. Use a subquery to first identify the child post with the highest score. This can be done with 'SELECT Id FROM posts ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1' to get the ID of the child post. 2. Then, modify the existing JOIN query to include a condition that ties this child post's ID to the parent post by matching it in the ON clause. 3. Ensure you are selecting the correct display name from the parent post. The final SQL query should look like this: 'SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM posts T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T1.Id = (SELECT Id FROM posts ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1);'. This ensures that you are specifically fetching the display name associated with the parent of the highest-scoring child post.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of describing the display name of the parent ID for the child post with the highest score, follow these steps: 1. Use a subquery to first identify the child post with the highest score. This can be done with 'SELECT Id FROM posts ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1' to get the ID of the child post. 2. Then, modify the existing JOIN query to include a condition that ties this child post's ID to the parent post by matching it in the ON clause. 3.

This ensures that you are specifically fetching the display name associated with the parent of the highest-scoring child post.
7. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to explicitly filter for the child post with the highest score in the initial selection before joining to the parent post.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of describing the display name of the parent ID for the child post with the highest score, follow these steps: 1. Use a subquery to first identify the child post with the highest score. This can be done with 'SELECT Id FROM posts ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1' to get the ID of the child post. 2. Then, modify the existing JOIN query to include a condition that ties this child post's ID to the parent post by matching it in the ON clause. 3. Ensure you are selecting the correct display name from the parent post. The final SQL query should look like this: 'SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM posts T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T1.Id = (SELECT Id FROM posts ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1);'. This ensures that you are specifically fetching the display name associated with the parent of the highest-scoring child post.
7. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to explicitly filter for the child post with the highest score in the initial selection before joining to the parent post. Here are the actionable steps: 1. First, select the child post with the highest score in a subquery. 2. Then, join this result with the posts table again to retrieve the OwnerDisplayName of the parent post associated with that child. 3. Modify the query to ensure that the selection makes it clear you are getting the child post based on its highest score. The revised SQL query should look like this: 

SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM (SELECT * FROM posts WHERE Score IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) AS T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id;
8. 1. Ensure the join is correctly linking the child post with its corresponding parent post. Modify the join condition to verify that 'T1.ParentId' correctly matches 'T2.Id'.
2. Since we are interested only in the display name of the parent post for the child post with the highest score, explicitly select 'T2.OwnerDisplayName' from the join to avoid any ambiguity in the results.
3. Consider using COALESCE or a similar function to handle cases when there might not be a matching parent post (though ideally, the data should ensure a parent exists for the highest-scoring child post).
4. Optionally, you could add an additional check to confirm that the retrieved parent is valid and exists; although the description doesn't require it explicitly, it's a good safeguard.
5. Finalize the query to ensure it focuses only on the necessary columns and logic to enhance readability and performance.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM posts T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T1.ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1.Score DESC LIMIT 1;', 'SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM posts T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T1.Score IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1.Score DESC LIMIT 1;', 'SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM posts T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T1.Score IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1.Score DESC LIMIT 1;', 'SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM (SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL AND Score IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) AS T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id;', 'SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM (SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL AND Score IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) AS T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id;']

Question: 
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score. 

Hint:
If the parent id is not null, the post is the child post; the highest score refers to MAX(Score);

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To solve the problem of retrieving the display name of the parent post for the child post with the highest score, I need to follow these steps: 1. Identify the child post with the highest score using a subquery to filter the posts table, ensuring that I only look at posts with a non-null score. This is done with an ORDER BY clause combined with LIMIT 1 to get the top post. 2. I need to ensure that I join the identified child post with its parent to extract the display name. This involves another layer of the join using the ParentId of the child post to link it with the corresponding post entry in the posts table. 3. In the final output, the query should focus on selecting the OwnerDisplayName column from the resulting joined table while maintaining clarity in the query through the use of aliases. The SQL query is designed to be efficient by utilizing ORDER BY along with LIMIT to avoid potential pitfalls of using MAX for retrieving values. Overall, careful attention was given to ensure the final output meets the question's requirement precisely, returning only the necessary display name of the parent post.",
