You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Replace the bond type used in the WHERE clause from '#' to a more appropriate symbol or identifier for triple bonds. Check the database schema or documentation to confirm the correct representation of triple bonds, which is typically '≡' or sometimes represented with the number '3'. Update the query accordingly, for example: 'WHERE T2.bond_type = '≡''.

2. Ensure that the total count of molecules in the denominator accurately represents all unique chemical compounds. Instead of 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule', consider 'SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) FROM molecule' if molecule_id is the unique identifier for each compound.

3. Make sure that the query appropriately captures the context of the dataset. If there are possible entries in the 'molecule' table that do not constitute valid chemical compounds (e.g., non-chemical entries), put in place a mechanism to exclude them based on valid conditions or identifiers.

4. Finally, validate that the JOIN operation correctly connects the 'bond' and 'molecule' tables based on molecule_id, and ensure that no filtering is done prematurely that could affect the final count of compounds with triple bonds.

Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Replace the bond type used in the WHERE clause from '#' to a more appropriate symbol or identifier for triple bonds. Check the database schema or documentation to confirm the correct representation of triple bonds, which is typically '≡' or sometimes represented with the number '3'. Update the query accordingly, for example: 'WHERE T2.bond_type = '≡''.

2. Ensure that the total count of molecules in the denominator accurately represents all unique chemical compounds. Instead of 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule', consider 'SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) FROM molecule' if molecule_id is the unique identifier for each compound.

3. Make sure that the query appropriately captures the context of the dataset. If there are possible entries in the 'molecule' table that do not constitute valid chemical compounds (e.g., non-chemical entries), put in place a mechanism to exclude them based on valid conditions or identifiers.

4. Finally, validate that the JOIN operation correctly connects the 'bond' and 'molecule' tables based on molecule_id, and ensure that no filtering is done prematurely that could affect the final count of compounds with triple bonds.
7. 1. **Clarify Bond Type Representation**: Verify if the bond type '#' is indeed the correct representation for a triple bond within the database schema. If it is not, replace it with the appropriate representation for triple bonds (e.g., 'triple' or another symbol). This ensures the accuracy of the count of compounds with triple bonds.

2. **Test for Absence of Triple Bonds**: Consider adding a condition to handle cases where there are no triple bonds in the dataset. This could prevent potential division by zero errors if the bond type does not exist in the table.

3. **Check for Compounds Without Bonds**: Ensure that the total count of compounds in the denominator includes those that do not have any bonds recorded. This may involve modifying the SQL query to utilize a LEFT JOIN instead of an INNER JOIN. For example, adjust the `JOIN` to a `LEFT JOIN` to make sure all molecules are counted, even if they lack a bond.

4. **Enhance Readability and Maintainability**: Consider creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) to separate the logic into more understandable parts: one that calculates the count of triple-bond molecules and another that counts total molecules.

5. **Result Formatting**: Make sure the result is accurately labeled and cast as a percentage directly in the SQL statement. This increases clarity when interpreting the output. 

Here’s a modified version of the SQL query to illustrate these adjustments:

```sql
WITH TripleBondCompounds AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT T1.molecule_id 
    FROM bond T2
    JOIN molecule T1 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id 
    WHERE T2.bond_type = '#' 
),
TotalCompounds AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) AS total_count FROM molecule
)
SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT T1.molecule_id) * 100.0 / NULLIF(TC.total_count, 0)) AS percent_triple_bond
FROM TripleBondCompounds T1, TotalCompounds TC;
```

This query counts the distinct molecules with triple bonds compared to the total number of distinct molecules, addressing the intent more accurately.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
[{'chain_of_thought': "To determine the percentage of compounds that form a triple bond, we need to first count the total number of unique compounds present in the molecule table. Then, we will count how many compounds have at least one triple bond. A triple bond is identified by bond_type = '#'. We can achieve this by joining the molecule table with the bond and connected tables to relate the bonds to the correct molecules. To compute the percentage, we need to use the formula (number of triple bond compounds / total number of compounds) * 100. As we need to display this percentage in the final result, we will use SQLite's division operation for computation and format it as a percentage. The resulting SQL query should appropriately reference the necessary tables and perform the aggregations as specified.", 'SQL': "SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT T1.molecule_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule)) AS percent_triple_bond FROM bond T2 JOIN molecule T1 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T2.bond_type = '#';"}, "SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT T1.molecule_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule)) AS percent_triple_bond FROM bond T2 JOIN molecule T1 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T2.bond_type = '#';", "SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT T1.molecule_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) FROM molecule)) AS percent_triple_bond FROM bond T2 JOIN molecule T1 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T2.bond_type = '#';", "SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT T1.molecule_id) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT molecule_id) FROM molecule)) AS percent_triple_bond FROM bond T2 JOIN molecule T1 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T2.bond_type = '#';"]

Question: 
Among all chemical compounds identified in the database, what percent of compounds form a triple-bond. 

Hint:
triple bond refers to bond_type = '#';

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the percentage of chemical compounds that form a triple bond. The SQL query builds two common table expressions (CTEs): one for identifying molecules with a triple bond type, and another for counting the total number of distinct molecules. The main query then calculates the percentage by dividing the count of triple-bonding compounds by the total count of compounds. The identification of triple-bonded compounds is correctly done via the 'bond' table and filtering for bond types that signify a triple bond ('#'). However, there's an assumption regarding the bond type representation. Assuming bond type '#' indeed represents triple bonds, the query logic holds. The use of NULLIF functions ensures division by zero is avoided. Thus, if the bond type designation holds true, the query aligns with the task and can generate the expected result. Therefore, the query fulfills the requirements of the question accordingly.",
