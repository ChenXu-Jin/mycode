This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
Who is the illustrator that illustrated the least amount of cards? List the format of play of the cards that he/she illustrated.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT T2.uuid FROM cards T1 JOIN legalities T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = (SELECT T1.artist FROM cards T1 GROUP BY T1.artist ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1)

Execution Result:
None

Evaluation Result:

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query to align it with the question's intent, follow these actionable steps: 1. **Select Required Columns**: Modify the SELECT statement to include both the `artist` (illustrator's name) and the `format` of play for the cards illustrated. 2. **Identify the Illustrator with Minimum Cards**: Instead of using a subquery that may return multiple artists, first create a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery that counts the number of cards illustrated by each artist, and then selects the artist(s) with the minimum count. This ensures you correctly identify who illustrated the least number of cards. 3. **Join with Legalities Table**: After identifying the artist with the least cards, ensure to join this result with the `legalities` table to fetch the formats of play related to the cards by that artist. 4. **Final Query Example**: Here\u2019s a revised version of the SQL query: \n\n```sql\nWITH ArtistCardCount AS (\n    SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS card_count\n    FROM cards\n    GROUP BY artist\n),\nMinArtist AS (\n    SELECT artist\n    FROM ArtistCardCount\n    WHERE card_count = (SELECT MIN(card_count) FROM ArtistCardCount)\n)\nSELECT DISTINCT c.artist, l.format\nFROM cards c\nJOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid\nWHERE c.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM MinArtist);\n``` \n5. **Verification**: Test this query to ensure it meets the requirements by returning the name of the illustrator with the least number of cards and the corresponding formats of play."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align it with the question's intent, follow these actionable steps: 1. **Select Required Columns**: Modify the SELECT statement to include both the `artist` (illustrator's name) and the `format` of play for the cards illustrated. 2. **Identify the Illustrator with Minimum Cards**: Instead of using a subquery that may return multiple artists, first create a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery that counts the number of cards illustrated by each artist, and then selects the artist(s) with the minimum count. This ensures you correctly identify who illustrated the least number of cards. 3. **Join with Legalities Table**: After identifying the artist with the least cards, ensure to join this result with the `legalities` table to fetch the formats of play related to the cards by that artist. 4. **Final Query Example**: Here’s a revised version of the SQL query: 

```sql
WITH ArtistCardCount AS (
    SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS card_count
    FROM cards
    GROUP BY artist
),
MinArtist AS (
    SELECT artist
    FROM ArtistCardCount
    WHERE card_count = (SELECT MIN(card_count) FROM ArtistCardCount)
)
SELECT DISTINCT c.artist, l.format
FROM cards c
JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid
WHERE c.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM MinArtist);
```

Input Data

Question:
Who is the illustrator that illustrated the least amount of cards? List the format of play of the cards that he/she illustrated.

SQL Query:
WITH ArtistCardCount AS (SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist), MinCardCount AS (SELECT MIN(card_count) AS min_count FROM ArtistCardCount), MinArtists AS (SELECT artist FROM ArtistCardCount WHERE card_count = (SELECT min_count FROM MinCardCount)) SELECT DISTINCT c.artist, l.format FROM cards c JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid WHERE c.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM MinArtists);

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align it with the question's intent, follow these actionable steps: 1. **Select Required Columns**: Modify the SELECT statement to include both the `artist` (illustrator's name) and the `format` of play for the cards illustrated. 2. **Identify the Illustrator with Minimum Cards**: Instead of using a subquery that may return multiple artists, first create a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery that counts the number of cards illustrated by each artist, and then selects the artist(s) with the minimum count. This ensures you correctly identify who illustrated the least number of cards. 3. **Join with Legalities Table**: After identifying the artist with the least cards, ensure to join this result with the `legalities` table to fetch the formats of play related to the cards by that artist. 4. **Final Query Example**: Here’s a revised version of the SQL query: 

```sql
WITH ArtistCardCount AS (
    SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS card_count
    FROM cards
    GROUP BY artist
),
MinArtist AS (
    SELECT artist
    FROM ArtistCardCount
    WHERE card_count = (SELECT MIN(card_count) FROM ArtistCardCount)
)
SELECT DISTINCT c.artist, l.format
FROM cards c
JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid
WHERE c.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM MinArtist);
``` 
5. **Verification**: Test this query to ensure it meets the requirements by returning the name of the illustrator with the least number of cards and the corresponding formats of play.
7. 1. Modify the inner query that retrieves the minimum artist to ensure that you are counting the cards accurately for the artist, not just filtering on the artist name; it also should handle multiple artists with the same minimum card count. Use a common table expression (CTE) to get the card counts first, then select the artist(s) from that result. 2. In the final selection, ensure to join the results of the CTE with the cards table to accurately capture all UUIDs illustrated by the artists with the minimum count before joining to the legalities table. 3. Adjust the final SELECT statement to ensure that it retrieves the correct formats for all cards that the identified artist(s) illustrated. Here’s a modified version of the SQL: 

WITH ArtistCardCount AS (SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist), 
MinCardCount AS (SELECT MIN(card_count) AS min_count FROM ArtistCardCount), 
MinArtists AS (SELECT artist FROM ArtistCardCount WHERE card_count = (SELECT min_count FROM MinCardCount)) 
SELECT DISTINCT c.artist, l.format FROM cards c 
JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid 
WHERE c.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM MinArtists);
8. 1. Modify the final SELECT statement to ensure it retrieves formats specifically for the artist who illustrated the least amount of cards. Instead of using a DISTINCT clause directly, we should first filter the cards based on the artist from MinArtists to appropriately tie the card formats to that specific artist. 2. Change the JOIN conditions if necessary to ensure the format is being derived correctly from the legalities table related to the artist's cards and not just the UUID. We need to ensure that we're accurately reflecting the artist's relationship with the cards and their formats clearly in the output. The corrected final SQL should look something like this: 

WITH ArtistCardCount AS (SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist), 
MinCardCount AS (SELECT MIN(card_count) AS min_count FROM ArtistCardCount), 
MinArtists AS (SELECT artist FROM ArtistCardCount WHERE card_count = (SELECT min_count FROM MinCardCount)) 
SELECT c.artist, l.format FROM cards c 
JOIN legalities l ON c.uuid = l.uuid 
WHERE c.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM MinArtists) 
AND c.artist IS NOT NULL;

Question: 
Who is the illustrator that illustrated the least amount of cards? List the format of play of the cards that he/she illustrated. 

Hint:
format of the cards refers to format; illustrator refers to artist; the least amount of cards refers to MIN(artist)
