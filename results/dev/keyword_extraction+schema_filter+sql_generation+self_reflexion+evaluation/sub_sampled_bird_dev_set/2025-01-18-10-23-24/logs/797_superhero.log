This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify the Mapping: First, confirm the mapping of 'eye_colour_id' and 'hair_colour_id' to the actual colors. Ensure that 'eye_colour_id = 7' corresponds to blue eyes and 'hair_colour_id = 9' corresponds to brown hair. If necessary, consult the database schema or any documentation that describes these mappings.

2. Modify the Query: If the IDs are confirmed to be correct, maintain the SQL query as is. If they are incorrect, update the ID values in the query to reflect the correct IDs for blue eyes and brown hair. For example, if 'blue eyes' is actually represented by 'eye_colour_id = X' and 'brown hair' by 'hair_colour_id = Y', the SQL should be adjusted accordingly:

   ```sql
   SELECT superhero_name FROM superhero AS T1 WHERE eye_colour_id = X AND hair_colour_id = Y;
   ```

3. Check Execution Results: Run the modified query and verify that the execution results accurately reflect the superheroes with blue eyes and brown hair. If the results are still not as expected, further investigate the data for possible discrepancies or inaccuracies.

4. Additional Filters (Optional): If there are other conditions (e.g., excluding certain superheroes, or only including those from specific comic universes), consider adding those to the WHERE clause to refine the results. However, only do this if it aligns with any additional requirements not captured in the original question.

Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify the Mapping: First, confirm the mapping of 'eye_colour_id' and 'hair_colour_id' to the actual colors. Ensure that 'eye_colour_id = 7' corresponds to blue eyes and 'hair_colour_id = 9' corresponds to brown hair. If necessary, consult the database schema or any documentation that describes these mappings.

2. Modify the Query: If the IDs are confirmed to be correct, maintain the SQL query as is. If they are incorrect, update the ID values in the query to reflect the correct IDs for blue eyes and brown hair. For example, if 'blue eyes' is actually represented by 'eye_colour_id = X' and 'brown hair' by 'hair_colour_id = Y', the SQL should be adjusted accordingly:

   ```sql
   SELECT superhero_name FROM superhero AS T1 WHERE eye_colour_id = X AND hair_colour_id = Y;
   ```

3. Check Execution Results: Run the modified query and verify that the execution results accurately reflect the superheroes with blue eyes and brown hair. If the results are still not as expected, further investigate the data for possible discrepancies or inaccuracies.

4. Additional Filters (Optional): If there are other conditions (e.g., excluding certain superheroes, or only including those from specific comic universes), consider adding those to the WHERE clause to refine the results. However, only do this if it aligns with any additional requirements not captured in the original question.
7. 1. Verify the ID mappings: Before making changes, confirm that 'eye_colour_id = 7' corresponds to blue eyes and 'hair_colour_id = 9' corresponds to brown hair in the database. If these mappings are incorrect, identify the correct IDs for blue eyes and brown hair. 

2. Modify the SQL query: If the IDs from step 1 are incorrect, update the SQL query to reflect the correct mappings once identified. For example, if the correct IDs are found to be 'eye_colour_id = X' for blue eyes and 'hair_colour_id = Y' for brown hair, change the query accordingly: 
   ```sql 
   SELECT superhero_name FROM superhero AS T1 WHERE eye_colour_id = X AND hair_colour_id = Y; 
   ``` 

3. Test the updated query: After modifying the SQL query with the correct IDs, run the query to ensure it returns the expected results based on the requirements of the question. 

4. Document the ID mappings: If the mappings are verified, consider documenting them for future reference to avoid similar issues in subsequent queries.
