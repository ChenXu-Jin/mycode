This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query to better align with the question's intent, follow these steps:\n1. **Clarify the Filter for Multiple Faces**: Instead of simply checking if 'side IS NULL', explicitly define the condition to exclude cards that are part of a double-faced set. You could potentially use a different column or a more precise condition that directly captures single-faced cards, if available.\n\n2. **Include 'convertedManaCost' in the SELECT Clause**: The query should also return 'convertedManaCost' to ensure that you can verify which card corresponds to the maximum cost. This can provide additional transparency and utility in your results.\n\n3. **Adjust the ORDER BY Clause**: Keep the existing ORDER BY clause to maintain the intended functionality of sorting the results based on highest converted mana cost.\n\n4. **Test the Output**: Lastly, run the modified query and validate that it accurately reflects the desired outcome, ensuring that the output returns the illustrator of the highest converted mana cost card that meets all filtering conditions.\n\nA potential SQL modification could look like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT artist, convertedManaCost \nFROM cards \nWHERE side IS NULL AND [additional_condition_to_exclude_double_faced_cards] \nORDER BY convertedManaCost DESC \nLIMIT 1;\n```"

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to better align with the question's intent, follow these steps:
1. **Clarify the Filter for Multiple Faces**: Instead of simply checking if 'side IS NULL', explicitly define the condition to exclude cards that are part of a double-faced set. You could potentially use a different column or a more precise condition that directly captures single-faced cards, if available.

2. **Include 'convertedManaCost' in the SELECT Clause**: The query should also return 'convertedManaCost' to ensure that you can verify which card corresponds to the maximum cost. This can provide additional transparency and utility in your results.

3. **Adjust the ORDER BY Clause**: Keep the existing ORDER BY clause to maintain the intended functionality of sorting the results based on highest converted mana cost.

4. **Test the Output**: Lastly, run the modified query and validate that it accurately reflects the desired outcome, ensuring that the output returns the illustrator of the highest converted mana cost card that meets all filtering conditions.

A potential SQL modification could look like this:

```sql
SELECT artist, convertedManaCost 
FROM cards 
WHERE side IS NULL AND [additional_condition_to_exclude_double_faced_cards] 
ORDER BY convertedManaCost DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

Additionally, I need to determine which of these cards has the highest converted mana cost (`convertedManaCost`), and I specifically need to retrieve the `artist` for that card. Therefore, I will filter the `cards` table by checking that `side IS NULL`, then sort the results by `convertedManaCost` in descending order and limit the query to return only the highest value.

Question: 
Among the cards that doesn't have multiple faces on the same card, who is the illustrator of the card art that has the highest cost of converted mana? 

Hint:
doesn't have multiple faces refers to side IS NULL; illustrator refers to artist

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the illustrator of the card art with the highest converted mana cost, specifically excluding cards with multiple faces. In the SQL query, the condition 'WHERE side IS NULL' implies we are selecting cards that don\u2019t have multiple faces, which matches the question's requirement. The query fetches both 'artist' and 'convertedManaCost' and sorts these cards by 'convertedManaCost' in descending order, limiting the results to just one card. This means the query appropriately selects the card with the highest converted mana cost and retrieves the corresponding artist.

Therefore, the execution result should deliver the correct illustrator of the card with the highest converted mana cost, validating the query. Therefore, all criteria in the question are met satisfactorily.",
