This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Please provide the ids of top three powerful pairs of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards sorted by Kingdom Foil id in alphabetical order.

SQL Query:
SELECT id FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC LIMIT 3;

Database Content:
{'cards': ['id', 'artist', 'asciiName', 'availability', 'borderColor', 'cardKingdomFoilId', 'cardKingdomId', 'colorIdentity', 'colorIndicator', 'colors', 'convertedManaCost', 'duelDeck', 'edhrecRank', 'faceConvertedManaCost', 'faceName', 'flavorName', 'flavorText', 'frameEffects', 'frameVersion', 'hand', 'hasAlternativeDeckLimit', 'hasContentWarning', 'hasFoil', 'hasNonFoil', 'isAlternative', 'isFullArt', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isOversized', 'isPromo', 'isReprint', 'isReserved', 'isStarter', 'isStorySpotlight', 'isTextless', 'isTimeshifted', 'keywords', 'layout', 'leadershipSkills', 'life', 'loyalty', 'manaCost', 'mcmId', 'mcmMetaId', 'mtgArenaId', 'mtgjsonV4Id', 'mtgoFoilId', 'mtgoId', 'multiverseId', 'name', 'number', 'originalReleaseDate', 'originalText', 'originalType', 'otherFaceIds', 'power', 'printings', 'promoTypes', 'purchaseUrls', 'rarity', 'scryfallId', 'scryfallIllustrationId', 'scryfallOracleId', 'setCode', 'side', 'subtypes', 'supertypes', 'tcgplayerProductId', 'text', 'toughness', 'type', 'types', 'uuid', 'variations', 'watermark'], 'foreign_data': ['id', 'flavorText', 'language', 'multiverseid', 'name', 'text', 'type', 'uuid'], 'legalities': ['id', 'format', 'status', 'uuid'], 'sets': ['id', 'baseSetSize', 'block', 'booster', 'code', 'isFoilOnly', 'isForeignOnly', 'isNonFoilOnly', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isPartialPreview', 'keyruneCode', 'mcmId', 'mcmIdExtras', 'mcmName', 'mtgoCode', 'name', 'parentCode', 'releaseDate', 'tcgplayerGroupId', 'totalSetSize', 'type'], 'set_translations': ['id', 'language', 'setCode', 'translation'], 'rulings': ['id', 'date', 'text', 'uuid']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",

############################## Human at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
Please provide the ids of top three powerful pairs of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards sorted by Kingdom Foil id in alphabetical order.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT id FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC LIMIT 3;

Execution Result:

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "To align the SQL query with the question's intent, perform the following modifications: 1. Define 'powerful pairs' by determining the criteria that establish a pair as powerful. This may require additional information or tables indicating the strength of the pairs. 2. Modify the SQL query to include a JOIN clause to match 'Kingdom Foil' with 'Kingdom Cards' based on their IDs. 3. Apply an aggregate function or a condition to filter or rank the pairs based on the established 'powerful' criteria. 4. Ensure the SELECT statement retrieves both 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards' ids and not just a single column. 5. Use an ORDER BY clause to sort the results by 'cardKingdomFoilId' in ascending order. 6. Limit the results to only the top three pairs that meet the powerful criteria. An example modification might look like: \"SELECT DISTINCT cf.id AS KingdomFoilId, cc.id AS KingdomCardId FROM kingdomFoils cf JOIN kingdomCards cc ON cf.id = cc.cardKingdomFoilId WHERE ... [your condition for powerful pairs] ORDER BY cf.id ASC LIMIT 3;\"."

Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, perform the following modifications: 1. Define 'powerful pairs' by determining the criteria that establish a pair as powerful. This may require additional information or tables indicating the strength of the pairs. 2. Modify the SQL query to include a JOIN clause to match 'Kingdom Foil' with 'Kingdom Cards' based on their IDs. 3. Apply an aggregate function or a condition to filter or rank the pairs based on the established 'powerful' criteria. 4. Ensure the SELECT statement retrieves both 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards' ids and not just a single column. 5. Use an ORDER BY clause to sort the results by 'cardKingdomFoilId' in ascending order. 6. Limit the results to only the top three pairs that meet the powerful criteria. An example modification might look like: "SELECT DISTINCT cf.id AS KingdomFoilId, cc.id AS KingdomCardId FROM kingdomFoils cf JOIN kingdomCards cc ON cf.id = cc.cardKingdomFoilId WHERE ... [your condition for powerful pairs] ORDER BY cf.id ASC LIMIT 3;".

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, perform the following modifications: 1. Define 'powerful pairs' by determining the criteria that establish a pair as powerful. This may require additional information or tables indicating the strength of the pairs. 2. Modify the SQL query to include a JOIN clause to match 'Kingdom Foil' with 'Kingdom Cards' based on their IDs. 3. Apply an aggregate function or a condition to filter or rank the pairs based on the established 'powerful' criteria. 4. Ensure the SELECT statement retrieves both 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards' ids and not just a single column. 5. Use an ORDER BY clause to sort the results by 'cardKingdomFoilId' in ascending order. 6. Limit the results to only the top three pairs that meet the powerful criteria. An example modification might look like: "SELECT DISTINCT cf.id AS KingdomFoilId, cc.id AS KingdomCardId FROM kingdomFoils cf JOIN kingdomCards cc ON cf.id = cc.cardKingdomFoilId WHERE ... [your condition for powerful pairs] ORDER BY cf.id ASC LIMIT 3;".
7. 1. Define 'Powerful Pairs': First, establish how to identify 'powerful pairs' of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards. This could involve a specific attribute that signifies power (e.g., attack points, defense points). Ensure to include this criterion in the query. 

2. Join Required Tables: If 'powerful' metrics are defined in a different table, you may need to perform a JOIN operation with the relevant tables (e.g., joining a 'foils' table with cards to access the power attributes of each Kingdom Foil). 

3. Group and Order Logic: Add a GROUP BY clause (if necessary) to group the results by the required identifiers (like cardKingdomFoilId) and possibly an aggregate function to determine the strength of the pairs. Then apply an ORDER BY clause based on the derived strength of the pairs. 

4. Retrieve Identifiers: Rather than simply selecting the card IDs, make sure to select necessary attributes such as cardKingdomFoilId and cardKingdomId that make up the pairs. Lastly, limit the selection to the top three powerful pairs using the LIMIT clause after applying the ORDER BY logic.

5. Updated SQL: The modified SQL could look similar to this (depending on the actual schema): 
   ```
   SELECT c.id
   FROM cards c
   JOIN foils f ON c.cardKingdomFoilId = f.id
   WHERE c.cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND c.cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL
   ORDER BY f.power DESC, c.cardKingdomFoilId ASC
   LIMIT 3;
   ```
   You will need to replace 'f.power' with the actual column used to determine power in your data structure.
8. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of retrieving the ids of the top three powerful pairs of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards, follow these steps: 1. Introduce a column or criteria that reflects the 'power' of the pairs. This could be based on a 'power' attribute in the 'cards' table, if available. 2. Modify the SELECT statement to include the necessary columns for identification of both Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards, potentially adding 'cardKingdomId'. 3. Use a suitable aggregation function, such as MAX(), or JOIN with a 'power' metric if 'power' is stored in a different table. 4. Add a GROUP BY clause if using an aggregation function, grouping by the relevant columns. 5. Ensure that the ORDER BY clause sorts by 'cardKingdomFoilId' in ascending order after filtering for the top pairs based on 'power'. 6. Limit the result set to 3 to meet the requirement. A revised query may look like: 

```
SELECT cardKingdomFoilId, cardKingdomId 
FROM cards 
WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY power DESC, cardKingdomFoilId ASC 
LIMIT 3;
```

Adjust the placeholders as necessary based on your schema for clarity on the 'power' attribute.
