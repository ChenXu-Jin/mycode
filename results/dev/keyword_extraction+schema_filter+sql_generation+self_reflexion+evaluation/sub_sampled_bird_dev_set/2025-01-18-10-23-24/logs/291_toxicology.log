You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

The formulation leads us directly to the SQL statement: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+'.",
    "SQL": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = '+'"

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to accurately count the number of carcinogenic chemical compounds in the database, follow these actionable steps: 1. **Identify the Correct Label**: Check the database documentation or the schema to understand what label or labels correspond to carcinogenic compounds. Confirm if there is a dedicated field or specific value(s) that identify carcinogenicity. 2. **Revise the SQL Query**: Once you've identified the correct labels, replace the current filter in the SQL query. For instance, if carcinogenic compounds are indicated by a label 'C', modify the query to: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = 'C';`. If there are multiple labels that indicate carcinogenicity, include them in the condition, for example: `WHERE label IN ('C', 'C1', 'C2')`. 3. **Review Additional Fields**: If there are other pertinent columns that might help refine the results, ensure they’re included in your filter appropriately, if necessary. This ensures that the query counts exactly those compounds that are known to be carcinogenic. 4. **Test the Query**: After modifying the query, run it against the database to verify that it returns the expected count of carcinogenic compounds, providing an answer that accurately aligns with the original question.
7. 1. Clarify the Meaning of the Label: Investigate the database schema or documentation to confirm what each label in the 'label' field represents. Ensure that you determine whether the label '+' indeed corresponds to carcinogenic compounds; if it does not, identify the correct label(s) that indicate carcinogenicity. 2. Update the Query Filter: If the label '+' is confirmed to relate to carcinogens, no change is needed. However, if a different label indicates carcinogenic compounds (for example, 'C' or 'carcinogenic'), update the WHERE clause accordingly: `WHERE label = 'C'`. 3. Consider Additional Conditions: If there are multiple attributes relevant to determining carcinogenicity in the database, further refine the WHERE clause to include those conditions for an accurate count. 4. Test the Modified Query: After changes, run the new SQL query and verify the results to ensure that they correctly reflect the number of carcinogenic compounds based on your updated understanding of the label definitions.
8. To modify the SQL query to correctly count the number of chemical compounds identified as carcinogenic, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Correct Label**: First, confirm the designation used in the database schema to indicate carcinogenic compounds. If a different label (e.g., 'carcinogenic', 'yes', etc.) is used to signify carcinogenicity, replace the label '+' in the SQL query accordingly.

2. **Update the WHERE Clause**: Adjust the WHERE clause in the SQL query to reflect the identified label for carcinogens. For example, if the correct label is 'carcinogenic', your query should look like this: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule WHERE label = 'carcinogenic'`.

3. **Who Can Help?**: If the schema is not available, consult with a database administrator or refer to the documentation of the database to find the exact representation of carcinogenic compounds.

4. **Test the Query**: After making the changes, execute the SQL query to verify that it accurately returns the count of carcinogenic compounds as intended. If modifications lead to unexpected results, consider further examining the data entries or querying for distinct labels to understand the data better.

By ensuring that the SQL query uses the correct label for carcinogenic compounds, you will align the query with the question's intent.
