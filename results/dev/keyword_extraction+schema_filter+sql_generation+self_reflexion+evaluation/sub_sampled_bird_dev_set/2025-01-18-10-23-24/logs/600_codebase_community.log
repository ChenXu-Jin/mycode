This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
List out all post that are related to post ID 61217 and what is the popularity of this post?

SQL Query:
SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217

Database Content:
{'badges': ['Id', 'UserId', 'Name', 'Date'], 'comments': ['Id', 'PostId', 'Score', 'Text', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postHistory': ['Id', 'PostHistoryTypeId', 'PostId', 'RevisionGUID', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'Text', 'Comment', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postLinks': ['Id', 'CreationDate', 'PostId', 'RelatedPostId', 'LinkTypeId'], 'posts': ['Id', 'PostTypeId', 'AcceptedAnswerId', 'CreaionDate', 'Score', 'ViewCount', 'Body', 'OwnerUserId', 'LasActivityDate', 'Title', 'Tags', 'AnswerCount', 'CommentCount', 'FavoriteCount', 'LastEditorUserId', 'LastEditDate', 'CommunityOwnedDate', 'ParentId', 'ClosedDate', 'OwnerDisplayName', 'LastEditorDisplayName'], 'tags': ['Id', 'TagName', 'Count', 'ExcerptPostId', 'WikiPostId'], 'users': ['Id', 'Reputation', 'CreationDate', 'DisplayName', 'LastAccessDate', 'WebsiteUrl', 'Location', 'AboutMe', 'Views', 'UpVotes', 'DownVotes', 'AccountId', 'Age', 'ProfileImageUrl'], 'votes': ['Id', 'PostId', 'VoteTypeId', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'BountyAmount']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to fully align with the question's intent, you should include an additional selection for the popularity metric of the specified post ID 61217 along with the related posts. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery to first retrieve the popularity details (e.g., ViewCount) for the post with ID 61217.
2. Update the SELECT statement to include both the popularity of post ID 61217 and the related posts' information. This can be done by selecting the related posts in the same result set or including it as separate output.
3. Join the tables as you already did, but also include a separate SELECT for the popularity of the main post (ID 61217).

Example revised SQL:

```sql
SELECT T2.Id AS RelatedPostId, T2.ViewCount AS RelatedPostViewCount,
       (SELECT ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217) AS OriginalPostViewCount
FROM postLinks AS T1 
JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id 
WHERE T1.PostId = 61217
```

This query retrieves both the related post IDs and their view counts, along with the view count of the specified post (ID 61217), thus fully addressing the question's requirements.

[{'chain_of_thought': "To answer the question, we need to identify posts that are related to the given Post ID 61217. The relationship is established using the postLinks table, where the RelatedPostId column corresponds to the given Post ID. We'll then join the posts table to retrieve the ViewCount for each of these related posts, which represents their popularity.

Question: 
List out all post that are related to post ID 61217 and what is the popularity of this post? 

Hint:
post related refers to RelatedPostId; popularity refers to ViewCount

Input Data

Question:
List out all post that are related to post ID 61217 and what is the popularity of this post?

SQL Query:
SELECT T2.Id AS RelatedPostId, T2.ViewCount AS RelatedPostViewCount, (SELECT ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217) AS OriginalPostViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217

Database Content:
{'badges': ['Id', 'UserId', 'Name', 'Date'], 'comments': ['Id', 'PostId', 'Score', 'Text', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postHistory': ['Id', 'PostHistoryTypeId', 'PostId', 'RevisionGUID', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'Text', 'Comment', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postLinks': ['Id', 'CreationDate', 'PostId', 'RelatedPostId', 'LinkTypeId'], 'posts': ['Id', 'PostTypeId', 'AcceptedAnswerId', 'CreaionDate', 'Score', 'ViewCount', 'Body', 'OwnerUserId', 'LasActivityDate', 'Title', 'Tags', 'AnswerCount', 'CommentCount', 'FavoriteCount', 'LastEditorUserId', 'LastEditDate', 'CommunityOwnedDate', 'ParentId', 'ClosedDate', 'OwnerDisplayName', 'LastEditorDisplayName'], 'tags': ['Id', 'TagName', 'Count', 'ExcerptPostId', 'WikiPostId'], 'users': ['Id', 'Reputation', 'CreationDate', 'DisplayName', 'LastAccessDate', 'WebsiteUrl', 'Location', 'AboutMe', 'Views', 'UpVotes', 'DownVotes', 'AccountId', 'Age', 'ProfileImageUrl'], 'votes': ['Id', 'PostId', 'VoteTypeId', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'BountyAmount']}
