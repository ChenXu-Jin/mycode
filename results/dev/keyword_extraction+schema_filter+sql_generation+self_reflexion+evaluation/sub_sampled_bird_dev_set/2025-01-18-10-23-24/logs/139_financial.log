This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Modify the SQL query to eliminate the specific filter for 'gold' credit cards and instead include all types of high-level credit cards that fit the criteria. One approach would be to create a list of high-level credit card types (such as 'gold', 'platinum', 'diamond', etc.) or use a general condition that captures all high-level categories. The revised query could look like this: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card AS T1 JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'diamond') AND T2.type = 'disponent';` This change ensures the query meets the requirement of counting all high-level credit cards and their corresponding disposition type without narrowing down to just one specific card type.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Modify the SQL query to eliminate the specific filter for 'gold' credit cards and instead include all types of high-level credit cards that fit the criteria. One approach would be to create a list of high-level credit card types (such as 'gold', 'platinum', 'diamond', etc.) or use a general condition that captures all high-level categories. The revised query could look like this: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card AS T1 JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'diamond') AND T2.type = 'disponent';` This change ensures the query meets the requirement of counting all high-level credit cards and their corresponding disposition type without narrowing down to just one specific card type.
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Clarify what constitutes 'high-level credit cards'. If 'gold' is not the only type that qualifies, identify all types that fit the description of 'high-level credit cards' (e.g., 'platinum', 'black', etc.). 2. Modify the WHERE clause to include all relevant card types by using an IN clause. For instance, replace 'T1.type = 'gold'' with 'T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'black')' if those are indeed the high-level types. 3. Ensure that the join condition between 'card' and 'disp' tables remains intact, as it is correctly joining on the 'disp_id'. The final SQL might look like this: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card AS T1 JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'black') AND T2.type = 'disponent'; 4. Test the modified query to ensure it returns counts that accurately reflect the number of high-level credit cards of the specified disposition type.

Short-Term Memory:

Question: 
How many high-level credit cards have "disponent" type of disposition? 

Hint:
High-level credit cards refers to the cards with the gold type.

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

The revised query could look like this: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card AS T1 JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'diamond') AND T2.type = 'disponent';` This change ensures the query meets the requirement of counting all high-level credit cards and their corresponding disposition type without narrowing down to just one specific card type.
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Clarify what constitutes 'high-level credit cards'. If 'gold' is not the only type that qualifies, identify all types that fit the description of 'high-level credit cards' (e.g., 'platinum', 'black', etc.). 2. Modify the WHERE clause to include all relevant card types by using an IN clause. For instance, replace 'T1.type = 'gold'' with 'T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'black')' if those are indeed the high-level types. 3. Ensure that the join condition between 'card' and 'disp' tables remains intact, as it is correctly joining on the 'disp_id'. The final SQL might look like this: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card AS T1 JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'black') AND T2.type = 'disponent'; 4. Test the modified query to ensure it returns counts that accurately reflect the number of high-level credit cards of the specified disposition type.
8. 1. Clarify which types qualify as 'high-level credit cards'. If 'gold' is the only type, then specify it within your database. If there are additional types (e.g., 'platinum', 'diamond'), ensure to include them. 2. Modify the WHERE clause to include all relevant high-level types. For example, use: WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'diamond') AND T2.type = 'disponent'. 3. Run the modified query to ensure it counts all qualifying high-level credit cards with the specified 'disponent' disposition type. 4. Verify the data model to ensure that 'high-level credit card' types are correctly defined and that you are not inadvertently excluding valid options.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To construct the SQL query for the given question, I started by identifying the key components of the question: we're looking for a count of high-level credit cards specifically of the type 'gold', and these should be associated with a disposition type of 'disponent'. First, I confirmed that 'gold' is the only type of high-level credit card we need to filter on, according to the hint provided. Next, I will use the 'card' and 'disp' tables since the card types are found in 'card' and the disposition types in 'disp'. To perform the count, I will employ a JOIN on the 'disp_id' from the card and disp tables, ensuring to implement the correct WHERE clause that filters by the card type ('gold') and the disposition type ('disponent'). Following the guiding principles mentioned, I will minimize any additional selection and focus purely on the count of matches. Therefore, the final SQL query will accurately reflect the task requirements without any unnecessary complexities or errors.",
