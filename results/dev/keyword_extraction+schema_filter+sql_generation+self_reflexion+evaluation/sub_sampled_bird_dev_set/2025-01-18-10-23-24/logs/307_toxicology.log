You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,

  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Revise the join conditions in the SQL query to ensure they correctly relate an atom to its respective connections through the bond. Instead of using 'OR' in the join condition, use multiple joins or a more specific join condition that accurately reflects how atom and connected atom IDs relate through bonded connections. Specifically: 
1. Replace the existing join condition from 'ON T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id OR T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id2' to 'ON T1.atom_id IN (T2.atom_id, T2.atom_id2)' to cover both cases without creating incorrect matches. 
2. Ensure that you only select relevant entries where the bond ID is 'TR000_2_3'. The modified query can look like this: 
   `SELECT T1.element 
    FROM atom AS T1 
    JOIN connected AS T2 ON T1.atom_id IN (T2.atom_id, T2.atom_id2) 
    JOIN bond AS T3 ON T2.bond_id = T3.bond_id

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Revise the join conditions in the SQL query to ensure they correctly relate an atom to its respective connections through the bond. Instead of using 'OR' in the join condition, use multiple joins or a more specific join condition that accurately reflects how atom and connected atom IDs relate through bonded connections. Specifically: 
1. Replace the existing join condition from 'ON T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id OR T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id2' to 'ON T1.atom_id IN (T2.atom_id, T2.atom_id2)' to cover both cases without creating incorrect matches. 
2. Ensure that you only select relevant entries where the bond ID is 'TR000_2_3'. The modified query can look like this: 
   `SELECT T1.element 
    FROM atom AS T1 
    JOIN connected AS T2 ON T1.atom_id IN (T2.atom_id, T2.atom_id2) 
    JOIN bond AS T3 ON T2.bond_id = T3.bond_id 
    WHERE T3.bond_id = 'TR000_2_3'` 
3. Validate that this revised approach retrieves only the correct element names associated with the specified bond.
7. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Replace the 'IN' clause in the JOIN condition with an 'OR' condition to properly check for equality. Specifically, change 'T1.atom_id IN (T2.atom_id, T2.atom_id2)' to 'T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id OR T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id2'. 2. Verify that you are selecting distinct elements to avoid duplicate results, which may not be required but can help ensure clarity. You might want to use 'SELECT DISTINCT T1.element'. 3. Ensure that the JOINs are correctly aligned to follow the logic of connecting atoms to the bond: first join `connected` with `atom` and then with `bond`. 4. After rewriting, your updated query should look like this: 'SELECT DISTINCT T1.element FROM atom AS T1 JOIN connected AS T2 ON (T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id OR T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id2) JOIN bond AS T3 ON T2.bond_id = T3.bond_id WHERE T3.bond_id = 'TR000_2_3''. This should meet the requirement of fetching elements from atoms that are associated with the specified bond.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the names of the elements that form the bond identified by 'TR000_2_3'. The SQL query is attempting to retrieve distinct elements from the 'atom' table, where these atoms are connected through the 'connected' table to a specific bond in the 'bond' table corresponding to 'TR000_2_3'. It uses a JOIN operation to connect the relevant tables using the appropriate keys: 'atom_id' from 'atom', 'bond_id' from 'connection', and 'bond_id' from 'bond'. The query seems to correctly set the filtering condition related to the bond_id, which aligns with the request made in the question. Therefore, the SQL query does fulfill the criteria set by the question and should return the correct results. Importantly, it selects distinct elements, ensuring there are no duplicates in the output. Thus, the query is appropriate for the question posed.",
