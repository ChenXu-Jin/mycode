This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Change the operation type in the WHERE clause from 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' to reflect 'statement of issuance' since this is the transaction type specified in the question. Confirm the exact operation string for 'statement of issuance' from the trans table. 

2. Ensure the query correctly correlated 'statement of issuance' with its respective transaction type. For example, if 'statement of issuance' corresponds to a different operation keyword or code, update the SQL to match that appropriately.

3. If the term 'after transaction' implies a chronological order, clarify if there's an additional date or timestamp condition needed in the query to sort transactions, ensuring that we only consider clients after this specific issuance transaction.

4. Lastly, verify that the joins between client, disp, and trans tables are still appropriate and yield results that meet the expected output of the question.

You might revise the SQL to something like this:

SELECT DISTINCT C.client_id 
FROM client C 
JOIN disp D ON C.client_id = D.client_id 
JOIN trans T ON D.account_id = T.account_id 
WHERE T.operation = 'statement of issuance' AND D.type = 'Disponent';

Hint:
'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' stands for issuance after transaction

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
List out the clients who choose statement of issuance after transaction are Disponent?

Predicted SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT C.client_id FROM client C JOIN disp D ON C.client_id = D.client_id JOIN trans T ON D.account_id = T.account_id WHERE T.operation = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' AND D.type = 'Disponent'

Execution Result:
None

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': "The question asks to list clients who choose statement of issuance with the specification that their transaction type is 'Disponent'. The SQL query attempts to join the client, disponent, and transaction tables based on matching client IDs and account IDs while filtering for a specific transaction operation and type.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:

  account    INTEGER          null,
  foreign key (account_id) references account (account_id)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Change the operation type in the WHERE clause from 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' to reflect 'statement of issuance' since this is the transaction type specified in the question. Confirm the exact operation string for 'statement of issuance' from the trans table. 

2. Ensure the query correctly correlated 'statement of issuance' with its respective transaction type. For example, if 'statement of issuance' corresponds to a different operation keyword or code, update the SQL to match that appropriately.

3. If the term 'after transaction' implies a chronological order, clarify if there's an additional date or timestamp condition needed in the query to sort transactions, ensuring that we only consider clients after this specific issuance transaction.

4. Lastly, verify that the joins between client, disp, and trans tables are still appropriate and yield results that meet the expected output of the question.

You might revise the SQL to something like this:

SELECT DISTINCT C.client_id 
FROM client C 
JOIN disp D ON C.client_id = D.client_id 
JOIN trans T ON D.account_id = T.account_id 
WHERE T.operation = 'statement of issuance' AND D.type = 'Disponent';
7. 1. Clarify the Transaction Criteria: Confirm the different types of transactions that qualify as 'statement of issuance.' If 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' is not the only valid transaction, update the WHERE clause to include all relevant transaction types, potentially using the 'IN' clause (e.g., WHERE T.operation IN ('POPLATEK PO OBRATU', 'OtherValidOperation')).

2. Ensure Proper Filtering for 'Disponent': Revisit the condition 'D.type = 'Disponent'' to ascertain it aligns with the business logic. If there are multiple types or this is just one of them, you may need to encapsulate them in an 'OR' statement or a more general condition.

3. Remove DISTINCT if Redundant: Assess whether the DISTINCT keyword is necessary. If the JOIN conditions guarantee unique entries already, its use could be unnecessary and may affect performance.

4. Validate Join Conditions: Ensure that the JOIN conditions accurately reflect the relationships between the client, disponent, and transaction tables. Confirm that the account structure logically maps to clients through disponents correctly.

5. Review Expected Output: Confirm exactly which client details are required in the output - just 'client_id,' or also other identifiers or attributes (e.g., client name). Update the SELECT statement accordingly if additional columns are needed.

6. Test the Query: After making the modifications, run the updated SQL query to ensure it returns the expected results, validating against known data points within your dataset.

{
