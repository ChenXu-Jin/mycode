This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Incorporate Salary Calculation: Modify the query to include a calculation of the average salary for female clients. This could involve using the AVG() function to compute the average from the salary field in the relevant table (likely the 'client' table, assuming it has a salary field). 

2. Filter for Oldest Clients: Ensure that after determining the average salary, the query filters for the oldest female clients. This can be done by grouping the results by account ID and using the MAX() function on the birth dates to find the oldest clients. 

3. Add Conditions for Average Salary: Implement a HAVING clause to filter the results to those clients whose average salary matches the lowest average salary among the group. You may need to calculate the lowest average salary in a subquery first. 

4. Refactor the Query: The final SQL query should focus on obtaining account numbers while properly addressing the requirements of age and salary averages and should look somewhat like this: 

   SELECT T1.account_id 
   FROM account T1 
   JOIN disp T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
   JOIN client T3 ON T2.client_id = T3.client_id 
   WHERE T3.gender = 'F' 
   GROUP BY T1.account_id 
   HAVING AVG(T3.salary) = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_salary FROM client WHERE gender = 'F' GROUP BY account_id) as avg_salaries) 
   AND T3.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') 
   LIMIT 1; 

5. Test the Query: After refactoring, run the query to ensure it retrieves the correct account numbers of female clients who are both the oldest and have the lowest average salary.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
[{'chain_of_thought': "To find the account numbers of female clients who are oldest and have the lowest average salary, I need to join several tables: 'client' to filter for female clients, 'district' to find the average salary by district, and 'account' to get the account information.

Question: 
Name the account numbers of female clients who are oldest and have lowest average salary? 

Hint:
Female refers to 'F' in the gender; A11 contains information about average salary

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Incorporate Salary Calculation: Modify the query to include a calculation of the average salary for female clients. This could involve using the AVG() function to compute the average from the salary field in the relevant table (likely the 'client' table, assuming it has a salary field). 

2. Filter for Oldest Clients: Ensure that after determining the average salary, the query filters for the oldest female clients. This can be done by grouping the results by account ID and using the MAX() function on the birth dates to find the oldest clients. 

3. Add Conditions for Average Salary: Implement a HAVING clause to filter the results to those clients whose average salary matches the lowest average salary among the group. You may need to calculate the lowest average salary in a subquery first. 

4. Refactor the Query: The final SQL query should focus on obtaining account numbers while properly addressing the requirements of age and salary averages and should look somewhat like this: 

   SELECT T1.account_id 
   FROM account T1 
   JOIN disp T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
   JOIN client T3 ON T2.client_id = T3.client_id 
   WHERE T3.gender = 'F' 
   GROUP BY T1.account_id 
   HAVING AVG(T3.salary) = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_salary FROM client WHERE gender = 'F' GROUP BY account_id) as avg_salaries) 
   AND T3.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') 
   LIMIT 1; 

5. Test the Query: After refactoring, run the query to ensure it retrieves the correct account numbers of female clients who are both the oldest and have the lowest average salary.
7. 1. **Separate Age and Salary Calculations**: Start by first identifying the oldest female clients and then calculate their average salary separately. This makes it clearer and avoids confusion with mixed aggregates. Use a CTE (Common Table Expression) or subqueries to simplify this. 

2. **Identify the Oldest Female**: Use a subquery to determine the maximum birth date of female clients and then filter for clients with that birth date. For example: 
   ``` WHERE T3.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') ``` 

3. **Calculate Average Salary for Oldest Clients**: After identifying the oldest female clients, calculate their average salary using a suitable aggregate function. This can also be done in a CTE or a subquery. 
   Example: 
   ``` 
   SELECT AVG(T4.A11) as avg_salary FROM district T4 JOIN client T3 ON T4.district_id = T3.district_id WHERE T3.gender = 'F' AND T3.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') ``` 
   
4. **Filter for the Lowest Average Salary**: Add a condition to filter the oldest female clients based on the minimum average salary calculated. Use another subquery or CTE that selects the minimum average salary from the previous step. 

5. **Final Query Composition**: Combine these results to fetch the account IDs of clients who match the criteria for being both the oldest and having the lowest average salary without ambiguity. Ensure to remove `LIMIT 1` since the intent is to find all matching accounts. 

6. **Overall Query Structure**: Ensure the final SQL query structure reflects these conditions clearly, using joins appropriately and focusing on improving readability and logical flow.

SELECT T1.account_id FROM account T1 JOIN disp T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id JOIN client T3 ON T2.client_id = T3.client_id JOIN district T4 ON T3.district_id = T4.district_id WHERE T3.gender = 'F' AND T3.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') GROUP BY T1.account_id HAVING AVG(T4.A11) = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM (SELECT AVG(A11) as avg_salary FROM district D JOIN client C ON D.district_id = C.district_id WHERE C.gender = 'F' AND C.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') GROUP BY C.client_id));

Execution Result:
(2836,)

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': "The question is asking for the account numbers of the female clients who are the oldest and have the lowest average salary. In the SQL query, there is an attempt to filter female clients based on their birth date, selecting the maximum birth date (which would yield the youngest, not the oldest). Additionally, the inner subquery aims to calculate the average salary but compares it to the minimum average salary. The query's aggregate function application and grouping might not fully match the requirement to identify the oldest female clients who also possess the lowest average salary. Furthermore, the structure does not ensure that the average salary is calculated correctly or that the results are filtered for clients who meet both of the criteria set in the question. These inconsistencies demonstrate a misalignment between the question and the SQL logic, indicating that it fails to provide the correct account numbers as requested.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

    "feedback": "1. **Identify Oldest Female Clients**: Modify the logic to select the oldest female clients by changing the subquery for birth_date. Instead of using MAX(birth_date), use MIN(birth_date) to find the oldest female clients: `(SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F')`. This will ensure you are capturing the correct clients.  \n2. **Calculate Average Salary**: Ensure that the average salary is calculated for the oldest female clients specifically. To do this, use a common table expression (CTE) or a nested query to first filter results of female clients with the oldest birth date and then calculate their average salaries only from these filtered results.  \n3. **Filter by Lowest Average Salary**: Introduce an additional layer to extract the lowest average salary calculated from the filtered clients. Use the appropriate aggregation (i.e., `MIN`) after identifying the average salaries of the oldest female clients.  \n4. **Valid Grouping**: Ensure correct grouping that aligns with both oldest age and salary criteria instead of grouping solely by account ID. The grouping should perhaps be done on gender and birth date first, before calculating the salary averages so the query filters the results correctly.  \n5. **Output Correct Columns**: Confirm that the output is accurately returning account numbers of female clients. Use a clean select statement to pull `T1.account_id` after all the filtering criteria have been applied.  \n6. **Sample Structure**: Consider structuring the SQL query like this:  \n```sql  \nWITH OldestFemaleClients AS (  \n  SELECT account_id, district_id  \n  FROM disp D  \n  JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id  \n  WHERE C.gender = 'F' AND C.birth_date = (SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F')  \n)  \nSELECT T1.account_id  \nFROM OldestFemaleClients OFC  \nJOIN district T2 ON OFC.district_id = T2.district_id  \nGROUP BY OFC.account_id  \nHAVING AVG(T2.A11) = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM (SELECT AVG(A11) as avg_salary  \n                      FROM district D  \n                      JOIN client C ON D.district_id = C.district_id  \n                      WHERE C.gender = 'F' AND C.birth_date = (SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F')  \n                      GROUP BY C.client_id));  \n```  \nThis structure ensures that the filtering and aggregation are accurate and are aligned with the intent of the original question."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Incorporate Salary Calculation: Modify the query to include a calculation of the average salary for female clients. This could involve using the AVG() function to compute the average from the salary field in the relevant table (likely the 'client' table, assuming it has a salary field). 

2. Filter for Oldest Clients: Ensure that after determining the average salary, the query filters for the oldest female clients. This can be done by grouping the results by account ID and using the MAX() function on the birth dates to find the oldest clients. 

3. Add Conditions for Average Salary: Implement a HAVING clause to filter the results to those clients whose average salary matches the lowest average salary among the group. You may need to calculate the lowest average salary in a subquery first. 

4. Refactor the Query: The final SQL query should focus on obtaining account numbers while properly addressing the requirements of age and salary averages and should look somewhat like this: 

   SELECT T1.account_id 
   FROM account T1 
   JOIN disp T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
   JOIN client T3 ON T2.client_id = T3.client_id 
   WHERE T3.gender = 'F' 
   GROUP BY T1.account_id 
   HAVING AVG(T3.salary) = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM (SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_salary FROM client WHERE gender = 'F' GROUP BY account_id) as avg_salaries) 
   AND T3.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') 
   LIMIT 1; 

5. Test the Query: After refactoring, run the query to ensure it retrieves the correct account numbers of female clients who are both the oldest and have the lowest average salary.
7. 1. **Separate Age and Salary Calculations**: Start by first identifying the oldest female clients and then calculate their average salary separately. This makes it clearer and avoids confusion with mixed aggregates. Use a CTE (Common Table Expression) or subqueries to simplify this. 

2. **Identify the Oldest Female**: Use a subquery to determine the maximum birth date of female clients and then filter for clients with that birth date. For example: 
   ``` WHERE T3.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') ``` 

3. **Calculate Average Salary for Oldest Clients**: After identifying the oldest female clients, calculate their average salary using a suitable aggregate function. This can also be done in a CTE or a subquery. 
   Example: 
   ``` 
   SELECT AVG(T4.A11) as avg_salary FROM district T4 JOIN client T3 ON T4.district_id = T3.district_id WHERE T3.gender = 'F' AND T3.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') ``` 
   
4. **Filter for the Lowest Average Salary**: Add a condition to filter the oldest female clients based on the minimum average salary calculated. Use another subquery or CTE that selects the minimum average salary from the previous step. 

5. **Final Query Composition**: Combine these results to fetch the account IDs of clients who match the criteria for being both the oldest and having the lowest average salary without ambiguity. Ensure to remove `LIMIT 1` since the intent is to find all matching accounts. 

6. **Overall Query Structure**: Ensure the final SQL query structure reflects these conditions clearly, using joins appropriately and focusing on improving readability and logical flow.
8. 1. **Identify Oldest Female Clients**: Modify the logic to select the oldest female clients by changing the subquery for birth_date. Instead of using MAX(birth_date), use MIN(birth_date) to find the oldest female clients: `(SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F')`. This will ensure you are capturing the correct clients.  
2. **Calculate Average Salary**: Ensure that the average salary is calculated for the oldest female clients specifically. To do this, use a common table expression (CTE) or a nested query to first filter results of female clients with the oldest birth date and then calculate their average salaries only from these filtered results.  
3. **Filter by Lowest Average Salary**: Introduce an additional layer to extract the lowest average salary calculated from the filtered clients. Use the appropriate aggregation (i.e., `MIN`) after identifying the average salaries of the oldest female clients.  
4. **Valid Grouping**: Ensure correct grouping that aligns with both oldest age and salary criteria instead of grouping solely by account ID. The grouping should perhaps be done on gender and birth date first, before calculating the salary averages so the query filters the results correctly.  
5. **Output Correct Columns**: Confirm that the output is accurately returning account numbers of female clients. Use a clean select statement to pull `T1.account_id` after all the filtering criteria have been applied.  
6. **Sample Structure**: Consider structuring the SQL query like this:  
```sql  
WITH OldestFemaleClients AS (  
  SELECT account_id, district_id  
  FROM disp D  
  JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id  
  WHERE C.gender = 'F' AND C.birth_date = (SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F')  
)  
SELECT T1.account_id  
FROM OldestFemaleClients OFC  
JOIN district T2 ON OFC.district_id = T2.district_id  
GROUP BY OFC.account_id  
HAVING AVG(T2.A11) = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM (SELECT AVG(A11) as avg_salary  
                      FROM district D  
                      JOIN client C ON D.district_id = C.district_id  
                      WHERE C.gender = 'F' AND C.birth_date = (SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F')  
                      GROUP BY C.client_id));  
```  
This structure ensures that the filtering and aggregation are accurate and are aligned with the intent of the original question.
