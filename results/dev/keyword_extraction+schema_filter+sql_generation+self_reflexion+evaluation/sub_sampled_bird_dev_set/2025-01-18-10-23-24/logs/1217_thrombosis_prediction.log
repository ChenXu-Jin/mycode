This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of assessing albumin levels for all patients born in 1982, regardless of whether they have lab entries or not, you should modify the JOIN from an INNER JOIN to a LEFT JOIN. This change will ensure that all patients born in 1982 are included in the results, even those without corresponding albumin data. Additionally, adjust the SELECT statement to include a separate indicator for patients without lab records, such as 'No Record' for those cases. The modified SQL query should look like this: 

SELECT T1.ID, 
CASE 
    WHEN T2.ALB BETWEEN 3.5 AND 5.5 THEN 'Normal' 
    WHEN T2.ALB IS NULL THEN 'No Record'

Question: 
For all patient born in 1982, state if their albumin is within normal range. 

Hint:
Year(Birthday) = '1982'; albumin is within normal range refers to ALB between 3.5 and 5.5

Input Data

Question:
For all patient born in 1982, state if their albumin is within normal range.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.ID, CASE WHEN T2.ALB BETWEEN 3.5 AND 5.5 THEN 'Normal' WHEN T2.ALB IS NULL THEN 'No Record' ELSE 'Abnormal' END AS Albumin_Status FROM Patient AS T1 LEFT JOIN Laboratory AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE STRFTIME('%Y', T1.Birthday) = '1982';

Database Content:
{'Examination': ['ID', 'Examination Date', 'aCL IgG', 'aCL IgM', 'ANA', 'ANA Pattern', 'aCL IgA', 'Diagnosis', 'KCT', 'RVVT', 'LAC', 'Symptoms', 'Thrombosis'], 'Patient': ['ID', 'SEX', 'Birthday', 'Description', 'First Date', 'Admission', 'Diagnosis'], 'Laboratory': ['ID', 'Date', 'GOT', 'GPT', 'LDH', 'ALP', 'TP', 'ALB', 'UA', 'UN', 'CRE', 'T-BIL', 'T-CHO', 'TG', 'CPK', 'GLU', 'WBC', 'RBC', 'HGB', 'HCT', 'PLT', 'PT', 'APTT', 'FG', 'PIC', 'TAT', 'TAT2', 'U-PRO', 'IGG', 'IGA', 'IGM', 'CRP', 'RA', 'RF', 'C3', 'C4', 'RNP', 'SM', 'SC170', 'SSA', 'SSB', 'CENTROMEA', 'DNA', 'DNA-II']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for albumin levels of patients born in 1982, classifying them as 'Normal', 'Abnormal', or 'No Record' based on whether their albumin (ALB) falls within the range of 3.5 to 5.5. The SQL query does the following: selects patient IDs and evaluates their albumin levels from the Laboratory table based on a condition that should be satisfied for patients born in 1982. The WHERE clause correctly filters patients by birth year. The CASE statement logically checks the albumin level for normal range; however, it uses BETWEEN correctly and also handles NULL values appropriately. Thus, the SQL query appears to correctly align with the question's requirements and should yield relevant results for those patients born in 1982. Since there are no evident missing components or logical discrepancies, the SQL query can be considered to properly address the question.",
    "judgment": "Valid"
