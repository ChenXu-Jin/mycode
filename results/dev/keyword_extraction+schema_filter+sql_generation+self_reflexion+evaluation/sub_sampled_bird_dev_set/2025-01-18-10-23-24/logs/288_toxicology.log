You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###

Omit this condition to ensure that all molecules containing the atom TR001_1 are considered. 2. **Include carcinogenicity information**: If there is a specific column or attribute in the 'molecule' table indicating whether a molecule is carcinogenic, you should include a condition that checks the carcinogenic status of the molecule (e.g., `WHERE m.is_carcinogenic = true`). If this attribute does not exist, it may be necessary to join with another table that contains this information. 3. **Select relevant columns**: Instead of only selecting the molecule_id, consider selecting the carcinogenicity status directly. For example, use SELECT m.molecule_id, m.is_carcinogenic to retrieve both the molecule_id and its carcinogenicity status. The updated SQL would look like: `SELECT m.molecule_id, m.is_carcinogenic FROM atom AS a JOIN molecule AS m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.atom_id = 'TR001_1'`. By implementing these modifications, the query will focus directly on identifying the carcinogenic properties of the relevant molecule.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)

);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of identifying whether the molecule containing atom 'TR001_1' is carcinogenic, follow these steps: 1. Ensure to join the relevant table that contains carcinogenicity information. This might typically involve a 'carcinogenicity' table or similar in your database schema. 2. Modify the SQL query to include a condition that checks the carcinogenic status of the molecule. For example, you could add a WHERE clause that filters based on a column like 'is_carcinogenic' in the identified carcinogenicity table (assuming such a column exists). 3. The updated SQL query could look like this: `SELECT m.molecule_id FROM atom AS a JOIN molecule AS m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id JOIN carcinogenicity AS c ON m.molecule_id = c.molecule_id WHERE a.atom_id = 'TR001_1' AND c.is_carcinogenic = true;` 4. Confirm the structure and names of the tables and columns used, to ensure correctness. This will ensure the query not only identifies molecules but also evaluates their carcinogenic properties, thus fulfilling the initial requirement.
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent of identifying whether the molecule containing atom TR001_1 is carcinogenic, follow these steps: 1. **Remove the label condition**: The current query filters for molecules with a label of '+', which is not necessarily related to carcinogenicity. Omit this condition to ensure that all molecules containing the atom TR001_1 are considered. 2. **Include carcinogenicity information**: If there is a specific column or attribute in the 'molecule' table indicating whether a molecule is carcinogenic, you should include a condition that checks the carcinogenic status of the molecule (e.g., `WHERE m.is_carcinogenic = true`). If this attribute does not exist, it may be necessary to join with another table that contains this information. 3. **Select relevant columns**: Instead of only selecting the molecule_id, consider selecting the carcinogenicity status directly. For example, use SELECT m.molecule_id, m.is_carcinogenic to retrieve both the molecule_id and its carcinogenicity status. The updated SQL would look like: `SELECT m.molecule_id, m.is_carcinogenic FROM atom AS a JOIN molecule AS m ON a.molecule_id = m.molecule_id WHERE a.atom_id = 'TR001_1'`. By implementing these modifications, the query will focus directly on identifying the carcinogenic properties of the relevant molecule.
8. 1. Identify the carcinogenicity information: First, check if there is a specific column in the 'molecule' table (or any related table) that indicates whether a molecule is carcinogenic. Look for a column such as 'is_carcinogenic' in the 'molecule' or any related table that might hold this information.
