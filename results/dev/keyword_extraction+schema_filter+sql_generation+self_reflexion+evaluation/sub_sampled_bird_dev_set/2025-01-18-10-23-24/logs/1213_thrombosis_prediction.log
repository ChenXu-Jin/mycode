This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, modify the WHERE clause to check if the ALP level is within the normal range, which is generally considered to be 40 to 300 units per liter. Update the SQL query to include an upper bound in addition to the lower bound for ALP. The modified query should be: SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1.Birthday = '1982-04-01' AND T2.ALP BETWEEN 40 AND 300;

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, modify the WHERE clause to check if the ALP level is within the normal range, which is generally considered to be 40 to 300 units per liter. Update the SQL query to include an upper bound in addition to the lower bound for ALP. The modified query should be: SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1.Birthday = '1982-04-01' AND T2.ALP BETWEEN 40 AND 300;
7. To align the SQL query with the question's intent more accurately, consider the following actionable steps: 1. Modify the condition for the ALP range to explicitly check if it falls within the normal range. If the normal range for ALP is, for example, between 40 and 150, the SQL query should reflect this. Update the WHERE clause to include both lower and upper bounds: `WHERE T1.Birthday = '1982-04-01' AND T2.ALP BETWEEN 40 AND 150`. 2. Ensure that the output column clearly reflects the ALP status by either returning it alongside the patient ID or include it in the result set if needed for further analysis. 3. The SQL query could also include a SELECT statement that makes it clear whether the ALP falls within the normal range by using a CASE expression to categorize it. For example: `SELECT T1.ID, CASE WHEN T2.ALP BETWEEN 40 AND 150 THEN 'Normal' ELSE 'Abnormal' END AS ALP_Status FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1.Birthday = '1982-04-01';` This approach ensures clarity in the results as it meets both parts of the question.

    "feedback": "1. Clarify the normal range for alkaline phosphatase (ALP): Determine the specific acceptable range for ALP levels. If, for example, normal ALP values range between 30 to 300 units, then adjust the query to check if ALP falls within this range. 2. Modify the SQL query: Change the WHERE clause to reflect the correct ranges for ALP. For example, using 'T2.ALP BETWEEN 30 AND 300' would ensure that the query captures instances where ALP is considered normal based on established ranges. 3. Ensure to include both conditions in your SQL: Confirm you are still filtering for the patient's birthday alongside the ALP level check. An updated query could look like: 'SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1.Birthday = '1982-04-01' AND T2.ALP BETWEEN 30 AND 300;'. 4. Validate results: After modifying the query, run it against the database to ensure it returns the correct patient ID based on the refined ALP criteria."

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, modify the WHERE clause to check if the ALP level is within the normal range, which is generally considered to be 40 to 300 units per liter. Update the SQL query to include an upper bound in addition to the lower bound for ALP. The modified query should be: SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1.Birthday = '1982-04-01' AND T2.ALP BETWEEN 40 AND 300;
7. To align the SQL query with the question's intent more accurately, consider the following actionable steps: 1. Modify the condition for the ALP range to explicitly check if it falls within the normal range. If the normal range for ALP is, for example, between 40 and 150, the SQL query should reflect this. Update the WHERE clause to include both lower and upper bounds: `WHERE T1.Birthday = '1982-04-01' AND T2.ALP BETWEEN 40 AND 150`. 2. Ensure that the output column clearly reflects the ALP status by either returning it alongside the patient ID or include it in the result set if needed for further analysis. 3. The SQL query could also include a SELECT statement that makes it clear whether the ALP falls within the normal range by using a CASE expression to categorize it. For example: `SELECT T1.ID, CASE WHEN T2.ALP BETWEEN 40 AND 150 THEN 'Normal' ELSE 'Abnormal' END AS ALP_Status FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1.Birthday = '1982-04-01';` This approach ensures clarity in the results as it meets both parts of the question.
8. 1. Clarify the normal range for alkaline phosphatase (ALP): Determine the specific acceptable range for ALP levels. If, for example, normal ALP values range between 30 to 300 units, then adjust the query to check if ALP falls within this range. 2. Modify the SQL query: Change the WHERE clause to reflect the correct ranges for ALP. For example, using 'T2.ALP BETWEEN 30 AND 300' would ensure that the query captures instances where ALP is considered normal based on established ranges. 3. Ensure to include both conditions in your SQL: Confirm you are still filtering for the patient's birthday alongside the ALP level check. An updated query could look like: 'SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T1.Birthday = '1982-04-01' AND T2.ALP BETWEEN 30 AND 300;'. 4. Validate results: After modifying the query, run it against the database to ensure it returns the correct patient ID based on the refined ALP criteria.

Question: 
Name the ID of the patient who is born on the April 1st, 1982. Is his/her alkaliphophatase (ALP) within normal range? 

Hint:
alkaliphophatase (ALP) within normal range refers to ALP < 300

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To generate the SQL query, I first need to clearly understand the requirements of the question. The question is asking for the ID of a patient born on April 1st, 1982, and whether their alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level is within the normal range (which, according to the hint, is defined as ALP < 300). I will join the Patient and Laboratory tables based on the patient ID. For the WHERE clause, I will filter for the birthday condition and also include a condition for the ALP level being less than 300. Since the question asks for the patient ID and does not require any other information, I will select only the patient ID. This ensures that I adhere to the guiding principles of selecting only the necessary columns and maintaining clear filtering conditions. The SQL query is thus constructed to reflect all these requirements precisely.",
