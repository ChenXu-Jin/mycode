You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Correct the bond_type condition: Change the WHERE clause to check for the correct bond type for double bonds. Instead of 'T2.bond_type = ' = '', use something like 'T2.bond_type = 'double'' (replace 'double' with the appropriate value in your data to correctly identify double bonds). 

2. Retrieve carcinogenic status correctly: Ensure that you are accessing the correct column that indicates whether 'TR006' is carcinogenic. Look into the 'molecule' table (T1) or possibly a related table to find the correct attribute that represents carcinogenicity. If it is in a different column, you should select that specific column instead of T1.label. 

3. A revised query structure could be as follows: 
   SELECT COUNT(T2.bond_id) AS double_bond_count, T1.carinogenic_column AS carcinogenic 
   FROM molecule AS T1 
   JOIN bond AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id 
   WHERE T1.label = 'TR006' AND T2.bond_type = 'double' 
   GROUP BY T1.carinogenic_column; 
   Make sure to modify 'carcinogenic_column' to match the actual column name that indicates the carcinogenic property. 

By making these adjustments, the SQL query should properly meet the requirements of the question.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Correct the bond_type condition: Change the WHERE clause to check for the correct bond type for double bonds. Instead of 'T2.bond_type = ' = '', use something like 'T2.bond_type = 'double'' (replace 'double' with the appropriate value in your data to correctly identify double bonds). 

2. Retrieve carcinogenic status correctly: Ensure that you are accessing the correct column that indicates whether 'TR006' is carcinogenic. Look into the 'molecule' table (T1) or possibly a related table to find the correct attribute that represents carcinogenicity. If it is in a different column, you should select that specific column instead of T1.label. 

3. A revised query structure could be as follows: 
   SELECT COUNT(T2.bond_id) AS double_bond_count, T1.carinogenic_column AS carcinogenic 
   FROM molecule AS T1 
   JOIN bond AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id 
   WHERE T1.label = 'TR006' AND T2.bond_type = 'double' 
   GROUP BY T1.carinogenic_column; 
   Make sure to modify 'carcinogenic_column' to match the actual column name that indicates the carcinogenic property. 

By making these adjustments, the SQL query should properly meet the requirements of the question.
7. 1. Update the carcinogenicity condition: Instead of checking if T1.label is '+', you should reference a specific field in the molecule or a related table that accurately indicates whether TR006 is carcinogenic or not. This could be a dedicated 'carcinogenic' column in the molecule table or another related dataset that categorizes the molecules. 

2. Adjust the WHERE clause for confirming the molecular label: Ensure you are checking for the correct molecular identifier (TR006) in a way that captures its full characteristics, not just dependent on the label attribute. Double check if TR006 might be represented or stored in any other format.

3. Aggregate results: Instead of using a CASE statement, consider using a direct selection from a designated carcinogenicity field. This could provide a clearer understanding of whether TR006 is carcinogenic without dependence on the case interpretation.

4. Consider handling cases where TR006 may not exist: Implement error handling or a check to return '0' double bonds and a default carcinogenic status if TR006 isn’t found in the dataset, to prevent misleading outputs.

Revised SQL Example: 
SELECT COUNT(T2.bond_id) AS double_bond_count, T1.carcinogenicity AS carcinogenic 
FROM molecule AS T1 
JOIN bond AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id 
WHERE T1.label = 'TR006' AND T2.bond_type = 'double' 
GROUP BY T1.carcinogenicity;
