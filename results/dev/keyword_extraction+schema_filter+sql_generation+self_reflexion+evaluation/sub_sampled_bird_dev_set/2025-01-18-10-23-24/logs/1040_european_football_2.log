Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: List the top 10 players' names whose heights are above 180 in descending order of average heading accuracy.

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these actionable steps: 1. Modify the SELECT clause to include player names instead of player_api_id. You will need to select the player's name from the Player table. Therefore, change 'SELECT T1.player_api_id' to 'SELECT T2.player_name'. 2. Ensure that the ORDER BY clause can utilize the average heading accuracy; include 'AVG(T1.heading_accuracy) AS avg_heading_accuracy' in your SELECT statement for clarity. 3. The GROUP BY clause should include the player_name to ensure proper aggregation. Update it to 'GROUP BY T2.player_name'. 4. Make sure to retain the filtering condition of height above 180 cm. The modified query should look like this: 'SELECT T2.player_name, AVG(T1.heading_accuracy) AS avg_heading_accuracy FROM Player_Attributes T1 JOIN Player T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T2.height > 180 GROUP BY T2.player_name ORDER BY avg_heading_accuracy DESC LIMIT 10;'. This will provide the top 10 player names as required, ordered by their average heading accuracy."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these actionable steps: 1. Modify the SELECT clause to include player names instead of player_api_id. You will need to select the player's name from the Player table. Therefore, change 'SELECT T1.player_api_id' to 'SELECT T2.player_name'. 2. Ensure that the ORDER BY clause can utilize the average heading accuracy; include 'AVG(T1.heading_accuracy) AS avg_heading_accuracy' in your SELECT statement for clarity. 3. The GROUP BY clause should include the player_name to ensure proper aggregation. Update it to 'GROUP BY T2.player_name'. 4. Make sure to retain the filtering condition of height above 180 cm. The modified query should look like this: 'SELECT T2.player_name, AVG(T1.heading_accuracy) AS avg_heading_accuracy FROM Player_Attributes T1 JOIN Player T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T2.height > 180 GROUP BY T2.player_name ORDER BY avg_heading_accuracy DESC LIMIT 10;'. This will provide the top 10 player names as required, ordered by their average heading accuracy.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
[{'chain_of_thought': "To address the question, we need to extract details from the Player_Attributes table, specifically focusing on players' heights from the Player table. We need to filter for players who are taller than 180cm, then calculate the average heading accuracy for these players. Since we want the top 10 players based on descending average heading accuracy, we'll group by the player ID and sort our results accordingly. Finally, we’ll select the player names while ensuring we apply the necessary aggregation to compute the average heading accuracy correctly.", 'SQL': 'SELECT T1.player_api_id FROM Player_Attributes T1 JOIN Player T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T2.height > 180 GROUP BY T1.player_api_id ORDER BY AVG(T1.heading_accuracy) DESC LIMIT 10;'}, 'SELECT T1.player_api_id FROM Player_Attributes T1 JOIN Player T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T2.height > 180 GROUP BY T1.player_api_id ORDER BY AVG(T1.heading_accuracy) DESC LIMIT 10;']

Question: 
List the top 10 players' names whose heights are above 180 in descending order of average heading accuracy. 

Hint:
height > 180; average heading accuracy = DIVIDE(SUM(heading_accuracy), COUNT(player_fifa_api_id));

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
