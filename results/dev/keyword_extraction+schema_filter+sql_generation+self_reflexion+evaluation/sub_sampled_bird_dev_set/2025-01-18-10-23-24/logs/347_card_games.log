This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

############################## Human at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniele' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;

Execution Result:
None

Evaluation Result:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Correct the artist name in the WHERE clause from 'Stephen Daniele' to 'Stephen Daniel' to ensure the query matches the intended artist. 
2. Extend the SELECT statement to include relevant attributes that indicate if the cards have missing or degraded properties. This could involve adding columns to check for NULL values or specific flags that denote the degradation of properties or values. 
3. Add appropriate conditions to the WHERE clause that filter these cards based on the properties you want to check for missing or degraded statuses—this could include checking for NULL values or specific flags in the respective properties columns. 
4. The modified SQL query may look something like this:

```sql

Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.id, T2.text, T1.hasContentWarning FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;

Database Content:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Correct the artist name in the WHERE clause from 'Stephen Daniele' to 'Stephen Daniel' to ensure the query matches the intended artist. 
2. Extend the SELECT statement to include relevant attributes that indicate if the cards have missing or degraded properties. This could involve adding columns to check for NULL values or specific flags that denote the degradation of properties or values. 
3. Add appropriate conditions to the WHERE clause that filter these cards based on the properties you want to check for missing or degraded statuses—this could include checking for NULL values or specific flags in the respective properties columns. 
4. The modified SQL query may look something like this:

```sql
SELECT T1.id, T2.text, T1.hasMissingProperties, T1.hasDegradedValues 
FROM cards T1 
JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid 
WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' 
AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1 
AND (T1.hasMissingProperties = 1 OR T1.hasDegradedValues = 1);
```
7. 1. Remove the condition that requires 'hasContentWarning = 1' to ensure the query retrieves all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel, regardless of their content warning status. 2. Add additional columns to select information indicating whether the cards have missing or degraded properties and values. This may involve checking specific fields that denote property quality in the 'cards' table. 3. Ensure that the JOIN condition correctly links the 'cards' table with the 'rulings' table based on the proper unique identifiers, confirming that T1.uuid = T2.uuid is accurate. 4. The modified query should include a check for any degraded or missing properties, which might require adding a relevant condition based on your database schema, such as 'T1.property_status IN ("missing", "degraded")' or a similar condition depending on how those statuses are stored.
8. 1. Remove the filter on 'hasContentWarning' in the WHERE clause to ensure that all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel are included, regardless of whether they have a content warning or not. This is essential to capture all relevant cards. 

2. Include a column to check for missing or degraded properties and values. This may require joining with another table or including additional logic that identifies these conditions, for example, by checking for NULL values or other flags that signify degradation. 

3. Ensure that the SELECT clause includes the necessary columns to meet the requirements: card ID, ruling text, and a flag or description indicating if there are any missing or degraded properties. 

4. A possible revised SQL query could look something like this: 

   SELECT T1.id, T2.text, CASE WHEN T1.property IS NULL OR T1.value IS NULL THEN 'Missing or degraded' ELSE 'Normal' END AS Status 
   FROM cards T1 
   JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid 
   WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel';

Question: 
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values. 

Hint:
cards have missing or degraded properties and value refers to hasContentWarning = 1; 'Stephen Daniele' is artist;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
