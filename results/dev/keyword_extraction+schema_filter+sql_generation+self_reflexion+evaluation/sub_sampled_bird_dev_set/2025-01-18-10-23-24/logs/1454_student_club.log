This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of calculating the percentage of costs associated with game events, modify the denominator to represent the total costs incurred instead of the count of events. You can do this by summing the costs of all expenses related to game events in the denominator as well. Here’s the updated SQL query:

SELECT (SUM(T3.cost) * 100.0 / SUM(T3.cost)) AS percentage FROM expense T3 JOIN budget T2 ON T3.link_to_budget = T2.budget_id JOIN event T1 ON T2.link_to_event = T1.event_id WHERE T1.type = 'Game';

Also, ensure that the total costs from all events (not just game events) are included in the denominator if you want a percentage calculation relative to all costs. If the intent is to find only the game events percentage against themselves, ensure both numerator and denominator refer to game event costs.

Question:
What is the percentage of the cost for the game events?

Predicted SQL:
SELECT (SUM(T3.cost) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT T1.event_id)) AS percentage FROM expense T3 JOIN budget T2 ON T3.link_to_budget = T2.budget_id JOIN event T1 ON T2.link_to_event = T1.event_id WHERE T1.type = 'Game';

Execution Result:
(None,)

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': "The question asks for the percentage of costs related to game events. The SQL query attempts to calculate this by summing the costs from the 'expense' table while also joining budget and event tables to filter for events of type 'Game'. The percentage is calculated based on the total cost of these events divided by the count of distinct 'event_id' associated with the game type. However, the use of COUNT(DISTINCT T1.event_id) as the denominator may not represent the intended comparison of costs to a meaningful overall figure (like total costs for events, or specific game costs), if no other total costs are being considered. Moreover, if the costs are specifically solely from game events, the correct denominator should correlate with the same set of costs. Thus, while the query addresses the filtering condition for 'Game', it may misconstrue the percentage calculation conceptually regarding how the costs of game events are represented proportionately, leading to potentially inaccurate results. Consequently, the SQL query does not fully and clearly answer the question as intended. Therefore, I consider it invalid.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

    "feedback": "To correctly calculate the percentage of costs for game events as intended by the question, update the SQL query as follows: 1. **Adjust the Denominator**: Instead of using COUNT(DISTINCT T1.event_id) as the denominator, you should sum all costs related to game events to ensure that you are calculating the percentage of game costs over total costs. 2. **Calculate Total Costs**: Introduce a subquery or a join that calculates the total costs of all events, not just game events. This could be done like so: `SUM(T3.cost)` for the game events divided by `SUM(T3.cost)` for all events. 3. **Revised SQL**: The SQL query could look like this: `SELECT (SUM(T3.cost) * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(cost) FROM expense)) AS percentage FROM expense T3 JOIN budget T2 ON T3.link_to_budget = T2.budget_id JOIN event T1 ON T2.link_to_event = T1.event_id WHERE T1.type = 'Game';` This way, you are calculating the game costs as a percentage of the total costs across all events, keeping the logic clear and relevant to the question's intent."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of calculating the percentage of costs associated with game events, modify the denominator to represent the total costs incurred instead of the count of events. You can do this by summing the costs of all expenses related to game events in the denominator as well. Here’s the updated SQL query:

SELECT (SUM(T3.cost) * 100.0 / SUM(T3.cost)) AS percentage FROM expense T3 JOIN budget T2 ON T3.link_to_budget = T2.budget_id JOIN event T1 ON T2.link_to_event = T1.event_id WHERE T1.type = 'Game';

Also, ensure that the total costs from all events (not just game events) are included in the denominator if you want a percentage calculation relative to all costs. If the intent is to find only the game events percentage against themselves, ensure both numerator and denominator refer to game event costs.
7. To correctly calculate the percentage of costs for game events as intended by the question, update the SQL query as follows: 1. **Adjust the Denominator**: Instead of using COUNT(DISTINCT T1.event_id) as the denominator, you should sum all costs related to game events to ensure that you are calculating the percentage of game costs over total costs. 2. **Calculate Total Costs**: Introduce a subquery or a join that calculates the total costs of all events, not just game events. This could be done like so: `SUM(T3.cost)` for the game events divided by `SUM(T3.cost)` for all events. 3. **Revised SQL**: The SQL query could look like this: `SELECT (SUM(T3.cost) * 100.0 / (SELECT SUM(cost) FROM expense)) AS percentage FROM expense T3 JOIN budget T2 ON T3.link_to_budget = T2.budget_id JOIN event T1 ON T2.link_to_event = T1.event_id WHERE T1.type = 'Game';` This way, you are calculating the game costs as a percentage of the total costs across all events, keeping the logic clear and relevant to the question's intent.

Question: 
What is the percentage of the cost for the game events? 

Hint:
game events refers to type = 'Game'; percentage = DIVIDE( SUM(cost), COUNT(event_id)) * 100
