You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Extend the SELECT clause to also include a field indicating whether the molecule is carcinogenic. This can be done by adding a condition to retrieve the carcinogenicity status from the molecule table. 2. Adjust the GROUP BY clause to ensure it includes the necessary fields for a valid query.

4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Extend the SELECT clause to also include a field indicating whether the molecule is carcinogenic. This can be done by adding a condition to retrieve the carcinogenicity status from the molecule table. 2. Adjust the GROUP BY clause to ensure it includes the necessary fields for a valid query. Specifically, you need to group by the bond type but also select the carcinogenicity information directly. 3. Modify the query to utilize a CASE statement, if applicable, to cleanly categorize the bond types while still pulling the carcinogenic status. The revised SQL query could look something like: `SELECT T1.bond_type, T2.label, T2.is_carcinogenic FROM bond AS T1 JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR018' GROUP BY T1.bond_type, T2.is_carcinogenic ORDER BY COUNT(T1.bond_type) DESC LIMIT 1`. This allows you to retrieve the predominant bond type and the relevant carcinogenicity information together.
7. 1. Include a column to check for carcinogenicity: Modify the SQL query to include a reference to the column or attribute that indicates whether the molecule 'TR018' is carcinogenic. This may involve joining a relevant table that contains carcinogenicity information about molecules. 

2. Modify SELECT statement: Adjust the SELECT clause to include a new expression for carcinogenicity, such as a CASE statement or a direct column selection, to return the carcinogenicity status alongside the bond type. 

3. Ensure columns are addressable in GROUP BY: If you add the carcinogenicity column, ensure that it aligns with the aggregation logic, either incorporating it into the GROUP BY clause or adjusting your selection logic to capture its presence correctly. 

4. Return both required pieces of information: Ensure the final SELECT returns both the majority bond type and the carcinogenicity status so that they can be displayed together in the result. 

5. Test the revised query: After applying the changes, run the modified SQL query to ensure it correctly provides the most common bond type for molecule TR018 along with its carcinogenicity status.

Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
