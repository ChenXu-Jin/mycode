This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question:

Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Find and list the names of sets which doesn't have Japanese translation but have Korean translation.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.name FROM sets T1 LEFT JOIN set_translations T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode WHERE T2.language = 'Korean' AND T1.code NOT IN (SELECT setCode FROM set_translations WHERE language LIKE '%Japanese%');

Database Content:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",

############################## Human at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
Find and list the names of sets which doesn't have Japanese translation but have Korean translation.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT T1.name FROM sets T1 LEFT JOIN set_translations T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode WHERE T2.language = 'Korean' AND T1.code NOT IN (SELECT setCode FROM set_translations WHERE language LIKE '%Japanese%');

Execution Result:
None

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': 'The question asks for a list of set names that do not have a Japanese translation but do have a Korean translation.

The conditions do not align accurately with the requirements in the question. Thus, the SQL query fails to provide the correct filtering to fulfill the intent of the question.', 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent of finding sets that have Korean translations but do not have Japanese translations, follow these steps: 1. Change the JOIN type from LEFT JOIN to INNER JOIN to ensure that you only get sets that have Korean translations. 2. Use a subquery to filter out sets that have Japanese translations as you've done, but you need to include a condition within the JOIN to specify only those translations. 3. Here's an updated version of the query:  \n\n```sql  \nSELECT T1.name  \nFROM sets T1  \nINNER JOIN set_translations T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode AND T2.language = 'Korean'  \nWHERE T1.code NOT IN (SELECT setCode FROM set_translations WHERE language = 'Japanese');  \n```  \n4. This query first joins on `set_translations` for Korean translations and then ensures that the `setCode` is not part of those that have a Japanese translation. This meets the requirements of the question."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent of finding sets that have Korean translations but do not have Japanese translations, follow these steps: 1. Change the JOIN type from LEFT JOIN to INNER JOIN to ensure that you only get sets that have Korean translations. 2. Use a subquery to filter out sets that have Japanese translations as you've done, but you need to include a condition within the JOIN to specify only those translations. 3. Here's an updated version of the query:  

```sql  
SELECT T1.name  
FROM sets T1  
INNER JOIN set_translations T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode AND T2.language = 'Korean'  
WHERE T1.code NOT IN (SELECT setCode FROM set_translations WHERE language = 'Japanese');  
```  
4. This query first joins on `set_translations` for Korean translations and then ensures that the `setCode` is not part of those that have a Japanese translation. This meets the requirements of the question.

Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
[{'chain_of_thought': "To solve the question, I need to find sets that have corresponding translations in Korean but lack translations in Japanese. To do this, I will join the 'sets' table and the 'set_translations' table. For sets with Korean translations, I will filter for language = 'Korean'. For sets without Japanese translations, I will filter out any sets where the language is 'Japanese'. The final output should only include the 'name' of the sets, aligning with the request for 'names of sets'. To accomplish this, I will use a LEFT JOIN to include all sets and their translations, then filter for the desired languages in the WHERE clause. The result will include only set names that meet the criteria.", 'SQL': "SELECT T1.name FROM sets T1 LEFT JOIN set_translations T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode WHERE T2.language = 'Korean' AND T1.code NOT IN (SELECT setCode FROM set_translations WHERE language LIKE '%Japanese%');"}, "SELECT T1.name FROM sets T1 LEFT JOIN set_translations T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode WHERE T2.language = 'Korean' AND T1.code NOT IN (SELECT setCode FROM set_translations WHERE language LIKE '%Japanese%');"]

Question: 
Find and list the names of sets which doesn't have Japanese translation but have Korean translation. 

Hint:
names of sets refers to name; doesn't have Japanese translation refers to language not like '%Japanese%'; have Korean translation refers to language = 'Korean'

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Input Data

Question:
Find and list the names of sets which doesn't have Japanese translation but have Korean translation.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.name FROM sets T1 INNER JOIN set_translations T2 ON T1.code = T2.setCode AND T2.language = 'Korean' WHERE T1.code NOT IN (SELECT setCode FROM set_translations WHERE language LIKE '%Japanese%');

Database Content:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the names of sets that do not have a Japanese translation but do have a Korean translation. The SQL query attempts to find this information by selecting names from the 'sets' table where there is a matching code in the 'set_translations' table specifically for 'Korean' and ensures that the same set code is not found in any translations for 'Japanese'. The query utilizes an inner join and a NOT IN clause effectively. However, the specific condition for identifying sets with a Korean translation and ensuring that no Japanese translation exists is properly addressed. Thus, the query matches the requirements stated in the question. Therefore, I conclude that the SQL query is valid in answering the given question.",
