The 'expense' table contains the 'expense_description' which represents the kind of expenses. To link the expenses to Sacha Harrison, I need to reference the 'member' table, where member details, including Sacha Harrison's name, are stored. The 'link_to_member' in the 'expense' table connects to the 'member_id' in the 'member' table. Thus, I will join the 'member' and 'expense' tables based on the member_id, filtering for Sacha Harrison using her first and last names. Finally, I will select the 'expense_description' from the 'expense' table to get the specific types of expenses she incurred.",
