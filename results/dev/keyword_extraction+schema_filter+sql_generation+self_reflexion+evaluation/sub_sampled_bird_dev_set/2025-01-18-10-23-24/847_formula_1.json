Since we are interested in the best lap time, I will use ORDER BY on the Q2 lap time in ascending order to find the minimum value, ensuring that I only consider non-null values. Next, I need to link this information to the driver table to get the driver's surname. I'll join the 'qualifying' table (for the Q2 times) with the 'drivers' table (to get the surnames) using the driverId. The final result should show the surname of the driver who has the best Q2 time while only returning that specific information.",
