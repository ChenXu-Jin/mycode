Therefore, I will filter the `cards` table by checking that `side IS NULL`, then sort the results by `convertedManaCost` in descending order and limit the query to return only the highest value. I will select the `artist` of that card as specified in the question. To comply with the data retrieval instructions, I will ensure that my SELECT clause only includes the `artist` column.",
