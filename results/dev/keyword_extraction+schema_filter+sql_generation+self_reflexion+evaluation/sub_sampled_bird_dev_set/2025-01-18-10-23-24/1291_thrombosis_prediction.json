The criteria for normal levels are defined as ALB being greater than 3.5 and less than 5.5, and TP falling between 6.0 and 8.5. Since I need to count the number of male patients who meet these conditions, I will use a JOIN operation to combine the Patient and Laboratory tables based on their foreign key relationship. Finally, I will use COUNT to get the total number of patients that meet the criteria, ensuring to filter out any records with null values in the relevant columns. Therefore, the final SQL query will count all male patients with the specified normal ranges for ALB and TP.",
