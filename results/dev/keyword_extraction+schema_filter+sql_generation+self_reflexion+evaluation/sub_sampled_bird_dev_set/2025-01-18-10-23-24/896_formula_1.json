First, I need to count the total number of races where Hamilton participated from 2010 onwards. This can be done by filtering the 'driverStandings' table for records matching Hamilton's driverId and within the specified year range. The second count will focus on how many of those races had Hamilton's position greater than 1. This will again use the 'driverStandings' table filtered as before, but this time by the position column. The final percentage can be calculated using a simple division of these two counts. To achieve this in SQL, I will use subqueries in the COUNT functions to get the required counts and then perform the division. The appropriate joins between the 'drivers', 'driverStandings', and 'races' tables will be necessary to filter by Hamilton's surname and count his races accordingly.",
