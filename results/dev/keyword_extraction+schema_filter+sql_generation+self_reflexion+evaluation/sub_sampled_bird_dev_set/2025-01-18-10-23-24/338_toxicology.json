I am specifically looking for atoms with element 'c' (for carbon) that are part of a bond with type ' = ' (for double bond) in the molecule with ID 'TR012'. First, I need to join the 'molecule', 'bond', 'connected', and 'atom' tables based on their relationships. After joining, I will filter for the specific molecule ID, bond type, and carbon element. Finally, I will select only the 'atom_id' associated with these conditions.",
