Then, we will count how many compounds have at least one triple bond. A triple bond is identified by bond_type = '#'. We can achieve this by joining the molecule table with the bond and connected tables to relate the bonds to the correct molecules. To compute the percentage, we need to use the formula (number of triple bond compounds / total number of compounds) * 100. As we need to display this percentage in the final result, we will use SQLite's division operation for computation and format it as a percentage. The resulting SQL query should appropriately reference the necessary tables and perform the aggregations as specified.",
