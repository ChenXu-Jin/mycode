Then, we need to find out how many accidents each driver had during that race. To do that, we will check the 'results' table and filter results by the race ID and where the statusId is 3 (indicating an accident). We can then group the results by driverId and count the number of accidents to find the driver who had the highest number of accidents. Finally, we will count the number of accidents for that specific driver and return it. The final query must adhere to the specified rules, selecting only relevant columns.",
