Identify the customers who bought product ID 5 at a price per unit greater than 29.00. The relevant tables for this are transactions_1k (T1), products, and customers.  We will calculate the price per unit by dividing the price by amount (Price/Amount).\n2.  Find the consumption status (consumption) for those customers in August 2012.  The relevant table is yearmonth (T2), and we need to filter the records where the date contains '201208'.\n3.  Join the results from steps 1 and 2 using the CustomerID to get the final consumption status.\n\nFollowing database admin instructions, I've used table aliases and made sure to select only requested column (Consumption).",
