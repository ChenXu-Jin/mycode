Identify the molecule of interest by filtering on the `molecule` table where `label` is TR006.\n2.  Count the number of double bonds associated with that molecule.  This involves joining `molecule`, `bond` and filtering on the `bond_type` column where it equals ' = '.\n3.  Identify whether TR006 is carcinogenic or not, by filtering on the `molecule` table, column `label`, where '+' means carcinogenic and '-' means non-carcinogenic. \n4. Combine 2 and 3 together to output the number of double bonds and whether TR006 is carcinogenic or not.\n",
