'Statement of issuance after transaction' is related to 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU', so I need to find a table that contains transaction information and a table that relates clients to accounts. The `trans` table contains information about transactions, and the `disp` table connects clients to accounts. So I need to join `disp` and `trans` tables using `account_id`. And also, the type in `disp` should be 'Disponent'.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n1. Filter records in `trans` where k_symbol is 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'.\n2. Filter records in `disp` where type is 'Disponent'.\n3. Join the tables `trans` and `disp` on their respective `account_id` columns.\n4. Select the distinct `client_id` from the joined table.",
