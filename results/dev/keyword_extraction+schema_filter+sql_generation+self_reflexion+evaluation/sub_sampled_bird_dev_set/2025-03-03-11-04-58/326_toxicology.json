The atom table has 'element' column that stores the information about the type of atom. The bond table has 'bond_type' column that stores the type of bond. So, I need to join these two tables to find the molecule id that satisfies these two conditions. Also, I need to connect these two tables using molecule_id. The tables atom and molecule have molecule_id and tables bond and molecule have molecule_id. The connected table connects atoms and bonds, using atom_id and bond_id columns respectively. The atom and bond tables are connected via the molecule table, using molecule_id.",
