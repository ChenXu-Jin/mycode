The superhero names are stored in the superhero table in the superhero_name column. The eye color is stored as an id in the superhero table in the eye_colour_id column, and the color itself is stored in the color table. We need to join the superhero table with the color table on the eye_colour_id column and filter on the color being blue. Similarly, hair color is stored in the superhero table in the hair_colour_id column and we need to join with the color table again, and filter on the color being brown.
