I need to join the satscores table and the schools table to filter down the results. Since the final answer is a count, I'll wrap the entire query in a COUNT aggregate function. First, filter for schools with AvgScrMath > 560 in the satscores table and join the result with the schools table on their common column 'CDSCode'. Then, I filter the joined table based on whether the school is directly charter funded using 'FundingType'. Finally, use the COUNT function to return the number of schools satisfying all conditions.",
