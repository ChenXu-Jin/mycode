The champion's time is directly available in the `results` table as `time` (HH:MM:SS.mmm). We need to find the time of the last finisher. Since the `time` column in the `results` table stores the incremental time of the driver to the winner, last finisher's time is equal to the incremental time added with champion's time. So the steps are:\n1. Find the `raceId` for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n2. Find the champion's `time` and `resultId` using `raceId` and `position = 1` from the `results` table.\n3. Find the `resultId` of last finisher by ordering the results based on their `positionOrder` in descending order.\n4. Select the last finisher's `time`, which represents the time difference from the winner.\n5. calculate the percentage difference.\n\n",
