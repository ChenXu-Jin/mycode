The `schools` table contains information about the school location (county).\n2. **Identify the relevant columns:**\n    - `County Name` in `frpm` is related to location, Los Angeles\n    - `Free Meal Count (K-12)` in `frpm` represents free meals.\n    - `FRPM Count (K-12)` in `frpm` represents free or reduced-price meals.\n3. **Construct the query:**\n    - Join `frpm` and `schools` table on `CDSCode`.\n    - Filter by `County Name` = 'Los Angeles'.\n    - Filter for `Free Meal Count (K-12)` > 500 and `FRPM Count (K-12)` < 700. Since there are mathematical comparisons, filter the null values by using a WHERE clause that makes sure the values are not null.\n    - Count the number of schools that satisfy the conditions. Because no specific columns are required, using COUNT(*) is the right choice.\n    - Add conditions to filter out null values related to number comparisons to avoid potential errors and ensure the final results are correct.",
