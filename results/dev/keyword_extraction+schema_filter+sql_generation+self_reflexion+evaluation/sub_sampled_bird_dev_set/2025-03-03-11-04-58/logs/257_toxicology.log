Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: List down atom id2 for atoms with element sulfur.
Hint: element sulfur refers to element = 's'

Please provide your findings as a Python list, capturing the essence of both the question and hint through the identified terms and phrases. 
Only output the Python list, no explanations needed.

You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
List down atom id2 for atoms with element sulfur. 

Hint:
element sulfur refers to element = 's'

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final SQL query.",
    "SQL": "Your SQL query in a single string."
}

Priority should be given to columns that have been explicitly matched with examples relevant to the question's context.

5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The current query selects `atom_id2` from the `connected` table where `atom_id` is an atom that has the element 'S' in the `atom` table. However, the question asks for `atom_id2` for *atoms* where the element is sulfur.  This implies that the final result set should also correspond to atoms that are sulfur. To correct this, you need to ensure that `atom_id2` in the `connected` table also corresponds to an atom with element 'S' in the `atom` table. Modify the query by adding another condition that checks if the `atom_id2` from the `connected` table is also an atom with element 'S' in the `atom` table.  Use a JOIN operation between the `connected` table and the `atom` table twice, once on `atom_id` and once on `atom_id2`, to achieve this. Specifically, join `connected` to `atom` as `a1` on `connected.atom_id = a1.atom_id` and `connected` to `atom` as `a2` on `connected.atom_id2 = a2.atom_id`. Then, filter both joined tables `a1` and `a2` based on `a1.element = 'S'` and `a2.element = 'S'`.

["SELECT T1.atom_id2 FROM connected AS T1 INNER JOIN atom AS T2 ON T1.atom_id = T2.atom_id WHERE T2.element = 'S'", "SELECT T1.atom_id2 FROM connected AS T1 INNER JOIN atom AS T2 ON T1.atom_id2 = T2.atom_id WHERE T2.element = 'S'", "SELECT atom_id2 FROM connected WHERE atom_id IN (SELECT atom_id FROM atom WHERE element = 'S')"]

Question: 
List down atom id2 for atoms with element sulfur. 

Hint:
element sulfur refers to element = 's'

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
