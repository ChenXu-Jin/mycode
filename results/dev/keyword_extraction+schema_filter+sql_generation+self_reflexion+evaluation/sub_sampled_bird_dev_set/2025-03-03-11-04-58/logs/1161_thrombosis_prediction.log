Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: For in-patient age 50 and above, what is their average anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) concentration?
Hint: in-patient refers to Admission = '+'; age 50 and above refers to SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(Birthday)) >= '50'; average anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) concentration refers to AVG(aCL IgG)

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

{
    "feedback": "The SQL query calculates age using `SUBSTR(strftime('%Y', 'now'), 3, 2)`, which only extracts the last two digits of the year, leading to incorrect age calculations and potentially including patients younger than 50. This is because it's only comparing the last two digits of the year, not the full year. Additionally, the subtraction order is incorrect and the logic is flawed, resulting in incorrect age calculation. Instead, use `CAST(strftime('%Y', 'now') AS INTEGER) - CAST(strftime('%Y', T2.Birthday) AS INTEGER)` to calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year. Also, ensure to include the correct year and month when performing the date subtraction for accurate age calculation. Here's how to adjust the query: \n\n1. **Correct the age calculation:** Replace `CAST(SUBSTR(strftime('%Y', 'now'), 3, 2) AS INTEGER) - CAST(SUBSTR(strftime('%Y', T2.Birthday), 3, 2) AS INTEGER) >= 50` with `CAST(strftime('%Y', 'now') AS INTEGER) - CAST(strftime('%Y', T2.Birthday) AS INTEGER) >= 50`.\n2. **Verify Data Integrity:** Ensure that the 'Birthday' column in the 'Patient' table and 'Examination Date' in the 'Examination' table contain valid date values to prevent errors during date calculations and aggregations. If the date format varies, use `strftime` to format the dates before performing calculations.\n\nRevised SQL:\n```sql\nSELECT avg(T1.`aCL IgG`) \nFROM Examination AS T1 \nINNER JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID \nWHERE T2.Admission = '+' AND CAST(strftime('%Y', 'now') AS INTEGER) - CAST(strftime('%Y', T2.Birthday) AS INTEGER) >= 50 AND T1.`aCL IgG` IS NOT NULL;\n```"

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The SQL query calculates age using `SUBSTR(strftime('%Y', 'now'), 3, 2)`, which only extracts the last two digits of the year, leading to incorrect age calculations and potentially including patients younger than 50. This is because it's only comparing the last two digits of the year, not the full year. Additionally, the subtraction order is incorrect and the logic is flawed, resulting in incorrect age calculation. Instead, use `CAST(strftime('%Y', 'now') AS INTEGER) - CAST(strftime('%Y', T2.Birthday) AS INTEGER)` to calculate the age by subtracting the birth year from the current year. Also, ensure to include the correct year and month when performing the date subtraction for accurate age calculation. Here's how to adjust the query: 

1. **Correct the age calculation:** Replace `CAST(SUBSTR(strftime('%Y', 'now'), 3, 2) AS INTEGER) - CAST(SUBSTR(strftime('%Y', T2.Birthday), 3, 2) AS INTEGER) >= 50` with `CAST(strftime('%Y', 'now') AS INTEGER) - CAST(strftime('%Y', T2.Birthday) AS INTEGER) >= 50`.
2. **Verify Data Integrity:** Ensure that the 'Birthday' column in the 'Patient' table and 'Examination Date' in the 'Examination' table contain valid date values to prevent errors during date calculations and aggregations. If the date format varies, use `strftime` to format the dates before performing calculations.

Revised SQL:
```sql
SELECT avg(T1.`aCL IgG`) 
FROM Examination AS T1 
INNER JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID 
WHERE T2.Admission = '+' AND CAST(strftime('%Y', 'now') AS INTEGER) - CAST(strftime('%Y', T2.Birthday) AS INTEGER) >= 50 AND T1.`aCL IgG` IS NOT NULL;
```

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT avg(T1.`aCL IgG`) FROM Examination AS T1 INNER JOIN Patient AS T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.Admission = '+' AND CAST(SUBSTR(strftime('%Y', 'now'), 3, 2) AS INTEGER) - CAST(SUBSTR(strftime('%Y', T2.Birthday), 3, 2) AS INTEGER) >= 50 AND T1.`aCL IgG` IS NOT NULL"]

Question: 
For in-patient age 50 and above, what is their average anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) concentration? 

Hint:
in-patient refers to Admission = '+'; age 50 and above refers to SUBTRACT(year(current_timestamp), year(Birthday)) >= '50'; average anti-cardiolipin antibody (IgG) concentration refers to AVG(aCL IgG)
