This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

{
    "feedback": "The query returns an empty set because the conditions specified in the WHERE clause are too restrictive, potentially not existing simultaneously in the dataset. To address this, review each condition for accuracy and necessity. Specifically, double-check that schools in 'Merced' county actually have 'Low Grade' = '9', 'High Grade' = '12', 'NSLP Provision Status' = '2', and 'EILCode' = 'HS' in the joined tables. If some of these conditions are optional or less critical, consider removing them or using OR conditions to broaden the search. It's also worth confirming the data types in the frpm table. For example, if `Low Grade` and `High Grade` are integers, remove the single quotes around the numbers (e.g., `T2.Low Grade` = 9)."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The query returns an empty set because the conditions specified in the WHERE clause are too restrictive, potentially not existing simultaneously in the dataset. To address this, review each condition for accuracy and necessity. Specifically, double-check that schools in 'Merced' county actually have 'Low Grade' = '9', 'High Grade' = '12', 'NSLP Provision Status' = '2', and 'EILCode' = 'HS' in the joined tables. If some of these conditions are optional or less critical, consider removing them or using OR conditions to broaden the search. It's also worth confirming the data types in the frpm table. For example, if `Low Grade` and `High Grade` are integers, remove the single quotes around the numbers (e.g., `T2.Low Grade` = 9).

Input Data
###
Erroneous SQL:
SELECT
  T1.City
FROM schools AS T1
INNER JOIN frpm AS T2
  ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode
WHERE
  T1.County = 'Merced' AND T2.`Low Grade` = '9' AND T2.`High Grade` = '12' AND T2.`NSLP Provision Status` = '2' AND T1.EILCode = 'HS';

Question:
What is the city location of the high school level school with Lunch Provision 2 whose lowest grade is 9 and the highest grade is 12 in the county of Merced?

Guidance:
High school can be represented as EILCode = 'HS'

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The query returns an empty set because the condition `T1.EILCode = 'HS'` likely filters out all schools that also satisfy the FRPM conditions. Try removing the condition `T1.EILCode = 'HS'` or consider whether filtering by EILCode is truly necessary to define a high school in this context, or if the grade levels are sufficient. If EILCode is indeed necessary, verify the correct EILCode value corresponding to a High School within the Schools table.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT\n  T1.City\nFROM schools AS T1\nINNER JOIN frpm AS T2\n  ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode\nWHERE\n  T1.County = 'Merced' AND T2.`Low Grade` = '9' AND T2.`High Grade` = '12' AND T2.`NSLP Provision Status` = '2' AND T1.EILCode = 'HS';", "SELECT\n  T1.City\nFROM schools AS T1\nINNER JOIN frpm AS T2\n  ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode\nWHERE\n  T1.County = 'Merced' AND T2.`Low Grade` = '9' AND T2.`High Grade` = '12' AND T2.`NSLP Provision Status` = '2' AND T1.EILCode = 'HS';", "SELECT\n  T1.City\nFROM schools AS T1\nINNER JOIN frpm AS T2\n  ON T1.CDSCode = T2.CDSCode\nWHERE\n  T1.County = 'Merced' AND T2.`Low Grade` = '9' AND T2.`High Grade` = '12' AND T2.`NSLP Provision Status` = '2' AND T1.EILCode = 'HS';"]

Question: 
What is the city location of the high school level school with Lunch Provision 2 whose lowest grade is 9 and the highest grade is 12 in the county of Merced? 

Hint:
High school can be represented as EILCode = 'HS'

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
