This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Question: 
How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix? 

Hint:
how much faster in percentage = divide(subtract(incremental time, champion time), last_driver time) * 100%; last driver finished time = incremental time + champion time; only champion's finished time is represented by 'HH:MM:SS.mmm'; finished the game refers to time is not null

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks to calculate the percentage difference in time between the champion and the last finisher in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix. The champion's time is directly available in the `results` table as `time` (HH:MM:SS.mmm). We need to find the time of the last finisher. Since the `time` column in the `results` table stores the incremental time of the driver to the winner, last finisher's time is equal to the incremental time added with champion's time. So the steps are:\n1. Find the `raceId` for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix.\n2. Find the champion's `time` and `resultId` using `raceId` and `position = 1` from the `results` table.\n3. Find the `resultId` of last finisher by ordering the results based on their `positionOrder` in descending order.\n4. Select the last finisher's `time`, which represents the time difference from the winner.\n5. calculate the percentage difference.\n\n",

{
    "feedback": "1. **Focus on `milliseconds` column:** The original query uses the `time` column, which can be null. The question implies that the 'time' represents race completion time. The `milliseconds` column in the `results` table accurately represents race times and is numeric.  Use this column instead.\n2. **Filter for non-null `milliseconds`:** Ensure that only drivers who finished the race are considered by adding a `WHERE milliseconds IS NOT NULL` clause in both subqueries.\n3. **Find the champion:** Use `positionOrder = 1` to identify the champion's time.\n4. **Find the last driver:**  Use `ORDER BY positionOrder DESC` and `LIMIT 1` to find the last driver's time. Handle the case where multiple drivers might have the same `positionOrder` (e.g., due to retirements).  Instead of relying *solely* on `positionOrder`, consider the highest `positionOrder` value where the race was completed, as signified by a non-null `milliseconds` value.\n5. **Calculate the percentage difference:** Calculate the percentage difference as `((last_driver_time - champion_time) * 100.0 / last_driver_time)`. Make sure to cast to REAL before multiplying by 100.0 to ensure floating point division.\n6. **Combine into a single query:** Construct a single query that performs these steps, avoiding unnecessary joins.\n\nHere's a refined SQL query based on these instructions:\n\n```sql\nSELECT CAST((T2.milliseconds - T1.milliseconds) AS REAL) * 100.0 / T2.milliseconds\nFROM (\n    SELECT milliseconds\n    FROM results AS T1\n    INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId\n    WHERE T2.year = 2008\n      AND T2.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n      AND T1.positionOrder = 1\n      AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL\n) AS T1,\n(\n    SELECT milliseconds\n    FROM results AS T1\n    INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId\n    WHERE T2.year = 2008\n      AND T2.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'\n      AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL\n    ORDER BY T1.positionOrder DESC\n    LIMIT 1\n) AS T2;\n```\n\nIf the above query still results in NULL, it is possible that no drivers completed the race, or that there is no clear winner. Handle these cases appropriately by returning NULL or 0 if there is no data to compute the speed difference.\n"

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. **Focus on `milliseconds` column:** The original query uses the `time` column, which can be null. The question implies that the 'time' represents race completion time. The `milliseconds` column in the `results` table accurately represents race times and is numeric.  Use this column instead.
2. **Filter for non-null `milliseconds`:** Ensure that only drivers who finished the race are considered by adding a `WHERE milliseconds IS NOT NULL` clause in both subqueries.
3. **Find the champion:** Use `positionOrder = 1` to identify the champion's time.
4. **Find the last driver:**  Use `ORDER BY positionOrder DESC` and `LIMIT 1` to find the last driver's time. Handle the case where multiple drivers might have the same `positionOrder` (e.g., due to retirements).  Instead of relying *solely* on `positionOrder`, consider the highest `positionOrder` value where the race was completed, as signified by a non-null `milliseconds` value.
5. **Calculate the percentage difference:** Calculate the percentage difference as `((last_driver_time - champion_time) * 100.0 / last_driver_time)`. Make sure to cast to REAL before multiplying by 100.0 to ensure floating point division.
6. **Combine into a single query:** Construct a single query that performs these steps, avoiding unnecessary joins.

Here's a refined SQL query based on these instructions:

```sql
SELECT CAST((T2.milliseconds - T1.milliseconds) AS REAL) * 100.0 / T2.milliseconds
FROM (
    SELECT milliseconds
    FROM results AS T1
    INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId
    WHERE T2.year = 2008
      AND T2.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'
      AND T1.positionOrder = 1
      AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL
) AS T1,
(
    SELECT milliseconds
    FROM results AS T1
    INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId
    WHERE T2.year = 2008
      AND T2.name = 'Australian Grand Prix'
      AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY T1.positionOrder DESC
    LIMIT 1
) AS T2;
```

If the above query still results in NULL, it is possible that no drivers completed the race, or that there is no clear winner. Handle these cases appropriately by returning NULL or 0 if there is no data to compute the speed difference.


Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT CAST((T2.time - T1.time) AS REAL) * 100 / (T2.time + T1.time) FROM (SELECT T1.time FROM results AS T1 INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId WHERE T2.year = 2008 AND T2.name = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND T1.position = 1) AS T1 , (SELECT T1.time FROM results AS T1 INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId WHERE T2.year = 2008 AND T2.name = 'Australian Grand Prix' ORDER BY T1.positionOrder DESC LIMIT 1) AS T2"]

Question: 
How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix? 

Hint:
how much faster in percentage = divide(subtract(incremental time, champion time), last_driver time) * 100%; last driver finished time = incremental time + champion time; only champion's finished time is represented by 'HH:MM:SS.mmm'; finished the game refers to time is not null

###
Question:
How much faster in percentage is the champion than the driver who finished the race last in the 2008 Australian Grand Prix?

Incorrect SQL:
SELECT CAST((T2.time - T1.time) AS REAL) * 100 / (T2.time + T1.time) FROM (SELECT T1.time FROM results AS T1 INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId WHERE T2.year = 2008 AND T2.name = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND T1.position = 1) AS T1 , (SELECT T1.time FROM results AS T1 INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId WHERE T2.year = 2008 AND T2.name = 'Australian Grand Prix' ORDER BY T1.positionOrder DESC LIMIT 1) AS T2

Correct SQL:
SELECT CAST((T2.milliseconds - T1.milliseconds) AS REAL) * 100.0 / T2.milliseconds FROM ( SELECT milliseconds FROM results AS T1 INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId WHERE T2.year = 2008 AND T2.name = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND T1.positionOrder = 1 AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL ) AS T1, ( SELECT milliseconds FROM results AS T1 INNER JOIN races AS T2 ON T1.raceId = T2.raceId WHERE T2.year = 2008 AND T2.name = 'Australian Grand Prix' AND T1.milliseconds IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1.positionOrder DESC LIMIT 1 ) AS T2
