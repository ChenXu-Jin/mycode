You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
What is the atom ID of double bonded carbon in TR012 molecule? 

Hint:
carbon refers to element = 'c'; double bond refers to bond_type = ' = ';

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final SQL query.",
    "SQL": "Your SQL query in a single string."

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,

  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The provided SQL query attempts to find the atom ID of a double-bonded carbon atom in a molecule labeled 'TR012'. However, it incorrectly joins the `connected` table. Here's how to refine the query:

1.  **Focus on the `bond` table:** The question asks about a 'double bond', which is directly represented in the `bond` table's `bond_type` column. We need to filter based on this.
2.  **Join `atom` and `molecule` tables:** Correctly join the `atom` and `molecule` table with the molecule label 'TR012'.
3.  **Join `atom` and `connected` table:** Connect `atom` table with the `connected` table using `atom_id` to determine connections to other atoms.
4.  **Join `connected` and `bond` table:** Connect `connected` table with `bond` table using `bond_id` and filter for double bonds represented as ' = '.
5.  **Select distinct `atom_id`:** Select distinct `atom_id` from `atom` table to avoid duplicates.

Revised Query Structure:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT T1.atom_id
FROM atom AS T1
INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id
INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id
INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id
WHERE T2.label = 'TR012'
  AND T1.element = 'C'
  AND T4.bond_type = '='
LIMIT 1;
```

Consider checking for connections where the `atom_id` or `atom_id2` in the `connected` table correspond to the initial atom, ensuring that you are actually capturing double bonds originating from the carbon atom rather than double bonds it connects *to*. The `connected` table shows the atoms at each end of the bond. Therefore we can also consider the inverse bond connection between the two atoms:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT T1.atom_id
FROM atom AS T1
INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id
INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id OR T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id2
INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id
WHERE T2.label = 'TR012'
  AND T1.element = 'C'
  AND T4.bond_type = '='
LIMIT 1;
```

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.atom_id FROM atom AS T1 INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id WHERE T2.label = 'TR012' AND T1.element = 'C' AND T4.bond_type = '=' LIMIT 1"]

Question: 
What is the atom ID of double bonded carbon in TR012 molecule? 

Hint:
carbon refers to element = 'c'; double bond refers to bond_type = ' = ';

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

4. **Ensure the molecule_id is consistent across relevant tables**: Filter the results to ensure that the molecule IDs from the atom, bond, and connected tables all match the molecule ID of TR012. This can be done by adding additional conditions to the where clause or as part of the joins.

Here is an example of how the SQL can be modified to implement these changes:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT T1.atom_id
FROM atom AS T1
INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id
INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id
INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id
INNER JOIN atom AS T5 ON T3.atom_id2 = T5.atom_id
WHERE T2.label = 'TR012'
  AND T1.element = 'C'
  AND T5.element = 'C'
  AND T4.bond_type = '='
  AND T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id
  AND T5.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id
LIMIT 1;
```

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The query currently joins 'atom' table twice, once as T1 and once as T5, and ensures both atoms are carbon atoms connected by a double bond within the 'TR012' molecule. However, it incorrectly uses `T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id AND T5.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id`. Since T1 and T5 represent *different* carbon atoms *within the same molecule*, checking that both have the same molecule_id as T2 is redundant and doesn't contribute to identifying the specific carbon atom involved in the double bond. It is already ensured by the joins. 

To improve the query, focus on selecting the 'atom_id' of carbon atoms (T1) that are connected to another carbon atom (T5) via a double bond (T4) within the 'TR012' molecule (T2). The condition `T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id AND T5.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id` can be removed since the molecule_id is already part of the join conditions through the connected table.

The revised query should look like this (but still may be suboptimal):

SELECT DISTINCT T1.atom_id FROM atom AS T1 INNER JOIN molecule AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id INNER JOIN connected AS T3 ON T1.atom_id = T3.atom_id INNER JOIN bond AS T4 ON T3.bond_id = T4.bond_id INNER JOIN atom AS T5 ON T3.atom_id2 = T5.atom_id WHERE T2.label = 'TR012' AND T1.element = 'C' AND T5.element = 'C' AND T4.bond_type = '=' LIMIT 1
