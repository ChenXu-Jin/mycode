This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

{
    "feedback": "1. The primary issue is that the subquery in the WHERE clause returns only one artist, which might not be the actual artist with the least number of cards illustrated. To find the artist(s) with the minimum number of cards illustrated, use a CTE (Common Table Expression) or subquery to first determine the minimum count of cards illustrated by any artist. Then, filter the results based on this minimum count.\n2. Modify the query to use a CTE or subquery to find the artist(s) who illustrated the least number of cards. This involves grouping by `artist` and counting the number of cards each artist illustrated, then finding the minimum of these counts.\n3. Join the `cards` and `legalities` tables using `uuid` to access the format information.\n4. Filter the results based on the artist(s) found in the CTE or subquery.\n5. Return the distinct `format` values to avoid redundancy.\n\nHere's an example of how to implement these steps:\n\n```sql\nWITH ArtistCounts AS (\n    SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS card_count\n    FROM cards\n    GROUP BY artist\n),\nMinCount AS (\n    SELECT MIN(card_count) AS min_card_count\n    FROM ArtistCounts\n)\nSELECT DISTINCT T2.format\nFROM cards AS T1\nINNER JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid\nINNER JOIN ArtistCounts AS AC ON T1.artist = AC.artist\nINNER JOIN MinCount AS MC ON AC.card_count = MC.min_card_count;\n```\n\nThis revised query first calculates the number of cards illustrated by each artist in the `ArtistCounts` CTE. Then, it finds the minimum of these counts in the `MinCount` CTE. Finally, it joins these CTEs with the `cards` and `legalities` tables to return the distinct formats of the cards illustrated by the artist(s) with the minimum number of cards."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. The primary issue is that the subquery in the WHERE clause returns only one artist, which might not be the actual artist with the least number of cards illustrated. To find the artist(s) with the minimum number of cards illustrated, use a CTE (Common Table Expression) or subquery to first determine the minimum count of cards illustrated by any artist. Then, filter the results based on this minimum count.
2. Modify the query to use a CTE or subquery to find the artist(s) who illustrated the least number of cards. This involves grouping by `artist` and counting the number of cards each artist illustrated, then finding the minimum of these counts.
3. Join the `cards` and `legalities` tables using `uuid` to access the format information.
4. Filter the results based on the artist(s) found in the CTE or subquery.
5. Return the distinct `format` values to avoid redundancy.

Here's an example of how to implement these steps:

```sql
WITH ArtistCounts AS (
    SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS card_count
    FROM cards
    GROUP BY artist
),
MinCount AS (
    SELECT MIN(card_count) AS min_card_count
    FROM ArtistCounts
)
SELECT DISTINCT T2.format
FROM cards AS T1
INNER JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid
INNER JOIN ArtistCounts AS AC ON T1.artist = AC.artist
INNER JOIN MinCount AS MC ON AC.card_count = MC.min_card_count;
```

This revised query first calculates the number of cards illustrated by each artist in the `ArtistCounts` CTE. Then, it finds the minimum of these counts in the `MinCount` CTE. Finally, it joins these CTEs with the `cards` and `legalities` tables to return the distinct formats of the cards illustrated by the artist(s) with the minimum number of cards.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT\n  T2.format\nFROM cards AS T1\nINNER JOIN legalities AS T2\n  ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid\nWHERE\n  T1.artist = (SELECT artist FROM cards GROUP BY artist ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1);']

Question: 
Who is the illustrator that illustrated the least amount of cards? List the format of play of the cards that he/she illustrated. 

Hint:
format of the cards refers to format; illustrator refers to artist; the least amount of cards refers to MIN(artist)

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Please summarize, based on the questions we provided, the incorrect SQL you generated, and the correct SQL, the step you must check when generating SQL statements again to prevent the same errors from recurring.

Input Data
###
Question:
Who is the illustrator that illustrated the least amount of cards? List the format of play of the cards that he/she illustrated.

Incorrect SQL:
SELECT
  T2.format
FROM cards AS T1
INNER JOIN legalities AS T2
  ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid
WHERE
  T1.artist = (SELECT artist FROM cards GROUP BY artist ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1);

Correct SQL:
WITH ArtistCounts AS (
    SELECT artist, COUNT(*) AS card_count
    FROM cards
    GROUP BY artist
),
MinCount AS (
    SELECT MIN(card_count) AS min_card_count
    FROM ArtistCounts
)
SELECT DISTINCT T2.format
FROM cards AS T1
INNER JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid
INNER JOIN ArtistCounts AS AC ON T1.artist = AC.artist
INNER JOIN MinCount AS MC ON AC.card_count = MC.min_card_count;
