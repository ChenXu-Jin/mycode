This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The current query joins `trans` and `disp` tables but doesn't ensure that the client associated with the 'Disponent' type in the `disp` table is the same client who performed the transaction with `k_symbol = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU'`. To correct this, you need to ensure that the client_id is the same in both the transaction and disp tables after joining them on the common key account_id. Modify the query by incorporating client_id from disp table after joining the tables on account_id and apply the condition on k_symbol from trans table.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT DISTINCT T2.client_id FROM trans AS T1 INNER JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id WHERE T1.k_symbol = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' AND T2.type = 'Disponent'"]

Question: 
List out the clients who choose statement of issuance after transaction are Disponent? 

Hint:
'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' stands for issuance after transaction

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. The current query attempts to find client IDs directly associated with 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' transactions and 'Disponent' types in the `disp` table. However, the transaction details and the disponent information reside in different tables and are related via account IDs. To correct this, you should join the `trans` table with the `disp` table on `account_id`, filter the `trans` table for transactions where `k_symbol` is 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU', and filter the `disp` table where type is equal to 'Disponent'. Finally, select the distinct client IDs from the `disp` table. Therefore, the query needs the following adjustments:

1.  Ensure that the table aliases are distinct (T1 and T2). The current query might be improved simply using T1 and T2 table aliases.
2.  Retain the JOIN condition between `trans` and `disp` tables on `account_id`.
3.  Keep the `WHERE` clause conditions for filtering 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' in the `trans` table and 'Disponent' in the `disp` table.
4.  The projection should select `DISTINCT T2.client_id` to return unique client IDs from the `disp` table.

In summary, the query structure is generally correct, but review the table aliases and double-check the WHERE clause to ensure you are filtering on the correct columns and values.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT DISTINCT T2.client_id FROM trans AS T1 INNER JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id WHERE T1.k_symbol = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' AND T2.type = 'Disponent'", "SELECT DISTINCT T2.client_id FROM trans AS T1 INNER JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id WHERE T1.k_symbol = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' AND T2.type = 'Disponent'"]

Question: 
List out the clients who choose statement of issuance after transaction are Disponent? 

Hint:
'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' stands for issuance after transaction

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
