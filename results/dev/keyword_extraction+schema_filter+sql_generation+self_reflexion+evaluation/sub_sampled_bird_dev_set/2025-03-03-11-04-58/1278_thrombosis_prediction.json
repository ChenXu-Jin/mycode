First, I need to find the patients with abnormal levels of anti-DNA-II. From the hint I know that abnormal anti-DNA-II is when DNA-II < 8. The DNA-II column is in the Laboratory table. Then, I need to find the patients who were admitted to the hospital. From the hint I know that admission to the hospital refers to Admission = '+'. The Admission column is in the Patient table. Finally, I need to join these two tables using the ID column, since the Patient table contains information about the patients, and the Laboratory table contains laboratory results for the patients, and the ID column relates patients to lab results. After joining the tables I need to filter the results to only include patients with abnormal DNA-II levels and who were admitted to the hospital. Then I need to count the number of patients that satisfy these conditions.",
