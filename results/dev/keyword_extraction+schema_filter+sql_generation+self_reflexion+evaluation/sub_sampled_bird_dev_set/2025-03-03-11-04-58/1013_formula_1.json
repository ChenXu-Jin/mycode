I need to identify the table containing lap times and the table containing circuit information. Then, I need to join these tables, filter for the Austrian Grand Prix, and find the minimum lap time. Since lap record means the fastest time recorded which refers to time, I should look for a table that contains \"time\" and \"circuit\". From the table schema, races table contains circuitId and lapTimes table contains time. Therefore, joining races and lapTimes tables on raceId and filtering the Austrian Grand Prix using circuits table and then finding the minimum of time in the lapTimes table will give the required answer. Also, I should include circuit name in the output since the question is specific about this. ",
