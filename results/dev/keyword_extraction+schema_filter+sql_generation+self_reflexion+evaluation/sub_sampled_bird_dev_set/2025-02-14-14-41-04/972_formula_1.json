I will first select the drivers born in 1971 by filtering the 'dob' column. Next, I will join this table with the 'results' table to get the details of their fastest lap times. To ensure that only the drivers with valid lap times are included, I will filter out any null values in the 'fastestLapTime' column from the 'results' table. Lastly, I need to select only the 'id' (driverId) and 'code' of these drivers. I'll use table aliases for improved readability.
