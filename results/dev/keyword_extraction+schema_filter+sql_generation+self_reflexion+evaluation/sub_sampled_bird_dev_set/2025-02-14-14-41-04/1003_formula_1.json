Determine which driver had the maximum number of accidents. \n4. Finally, retrieve the count of accidents for that specific driver. \nThus, the final SQL query first finds the raceId for the Canadian Grand Prix, then counts accidents for drivers in that race, orders the counts in descending order, and limits the output to the top driver, fetching the accident count only for that driver.",
