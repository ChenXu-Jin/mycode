The average score for all subjects can be calculated by adding the AvgScrMath, AvgScrRead, and AvgScrWrite columns together. Once I determine which school has the lowest total score, I need to select its average math score (AvgScrMath) and the county where that school is located (County). To do this, I'll need to join the satscores table with the schools table on the CDSCode. Since I want the lowest average score, I will use ORDER BY to sort the total average scores in ascending order and LIMIT 1 to fetch only the school with the lowest score. Finally, the SELECT statement should retrieve only the necessary columns: AvgScrMath and the county name.",
