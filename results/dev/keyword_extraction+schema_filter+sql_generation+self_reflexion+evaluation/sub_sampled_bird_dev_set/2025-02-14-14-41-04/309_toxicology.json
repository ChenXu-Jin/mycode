First, I will identify the molecule_id for 'TR346' from the molecule table. Then, I will use that molecule_id to find the corresponding atom_ids in the atom table. For the bond types, I will count the distinct bond types associated with the specified molecule_id. I will achieve this by performing a join between the bond table and the atom table using the molecule_id as the key. In the final query, I will select atom_id and the count of distinct bond types while ensuring that I group the results appropriately.",
