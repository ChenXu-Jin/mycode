The question asks for the city location of a high school, which is identified by the EILCode value 'HS'. I need to filter schools that have a Lunch Provision status of 2, which corresponds to 'NSLP Provision Status', implying that the school is part of the National School Lunch Program. Additionally, the grades should be within 9 (low grade) and 12 (high grade), and it should be located in the county of Merced. I will need to combine fields from the 'frpm' table for the grade and lunch provision conditions with the 'schools' table for the city location and county information. To get the result, I will select the 'City' column only, ensure to join the tables on the CDSCode, and apply the necessary filtering conditions as specified. I will order the results to find the one that meets all criteria specifically without using unnecessary columns in the SELECT clause. Finally, as per the database admin instructions, I will structure my SQL carefully to ensure compliance with the commands provided.",
