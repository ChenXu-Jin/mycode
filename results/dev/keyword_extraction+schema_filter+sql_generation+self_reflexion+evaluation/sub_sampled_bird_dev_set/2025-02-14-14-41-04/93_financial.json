The gender filter is straightforward, as I am looking for 'M'. For the district, I need to find the row in the district table with A3 implying 'North Bohemia'. Lastly, I'll need to apply the salary condition (A11 > 8000). I'll use JOIN operations to combine the 'client' and 'district' tables to apply these filters. Finally, I will count the number of records that meet these criteria. The final query will utilize the COUNT function and ensure I filter by the appropriate conditions.",
