This involves querying the 'satscores' table to identify the entry with the lowest 'AvgScrRead' while also ensuring that the associated school is in the correct district by joining the 'schools' table. The 'satscores' table contains the 'AvgScrRead' and 'cds' columns, while the 'schools' table contains the 'Phone' and 'District' columns. I will first select the minimum reading average score from 'satscores' for schools located in 'Fresno Unified', and then I will extract the phone number for that specific school. Since I only need the telephone number, I will include only that column in the SELECT clause. Following the guidance, I will use the ORDER BY clause to find the lowest score and limit the results to one entry.",
