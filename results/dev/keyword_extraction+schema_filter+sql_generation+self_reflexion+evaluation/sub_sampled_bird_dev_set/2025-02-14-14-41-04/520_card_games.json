This requires counting the number of cards for each artist from the 'cards' table, grouping by artist, and then selecting the artist with the minimum count. After identifying that artist, I need to get the format of the cards they illustrated, which is stored in the 'legalities' table linked via the uuid. Therefore, I'll join the 'cards' table and the 'legalities' table on the uuid column, selecting the format associated with the artist who has the least number of cards. The final query uses GROUP BY and ORDER BY to ensure we get the artist with the least cards and then retrieves the associated format of their cards.",
