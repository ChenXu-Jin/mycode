Additionally, we want patients who have been admitted to the hospital, meaning their Admission status must equal '+'. I need to gather information from the Patient table, specifically the ID and the Admission column, as well as data from the Laboratory table for the anti-DNA-II levels. I will join these two tables on the common ID column, apply the filters for DNA-II and Admission status, and finally count the distinct patients that meet these criteria.",
