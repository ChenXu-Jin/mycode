This means I will need to perform a join operation between the 'sets' table and the 'set_translations' table. I will filter the dataset for Korean translations (language = 'Korean') and ensure that those records do not have any Japanese translations (language not like '%Japanese%'). To do this, I can use a left join and check for null values in the Japanese translation. Finally, I will select the names of the sets from the 'sets' table where these criteria are met. The condition for avoiding Japanese translation can be handled by a NOT EXISTS clause or by ensuring no entries for Japanese are linked to the sets being queried. I will then structure the SQL query accordingly.",
