First, I calculate the price per unit for this product in the 'transactions_1k' table using the formula Price / Amount. To do that, I need to filter for records with ProductID = 5. After finding those transactions that meet the price condition, I can link the results to the 'yearmonth' table to find the consumption status for each customer in August 2012 (indicated by '201208' in the Date column). Finally, I select the relevant consumption status for these customers.
