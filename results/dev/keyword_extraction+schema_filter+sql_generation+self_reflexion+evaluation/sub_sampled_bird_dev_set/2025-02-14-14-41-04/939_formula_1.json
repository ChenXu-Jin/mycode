The 'races' table provides information about the 2008 Australian Grand Prix, including the year (2008) and possibly the race name. We can find which race corresponds to the Australian Grand Prix in 2008, and then link that to the 'results' table to get the drivers that participated in that race. I will join these tables: 'drivers', 'results', and 'races'. I need to ensure to count the distinct drivers that match the nationality criteria and participated in the specific race.
