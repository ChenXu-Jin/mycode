First, I identify the tables: the 'expense' table contains cost information and the 'event' table allows me to filter for type 'Game'. I need to use a JOIN to connect these two tables based on the link to the budget (and subsequently the event). Using the DIVIDE notion provided, I will format the query to compute this percentage in SQLite's style since it does not support the DIVIDE function directly. The formula includes filtering for game events and correctly grouping and summing the values.",
