First, I need to join the relevant tables to connect the bond with the atoms. Specifically, I will join the 'bond' table (T1) with the 'connected' table (T2) on the bond_id to find the atom_id values that are connected by this specific bond. Next, I will join that result with the 'atom' table (T3) to obtain the elements associated with those atoms. Finally, I'll select the 'element' column from the 'atom' table while ensuring I only get results where the bond_id matches 'TR000_2_3'.",
