We will look into the 'schools' table which contains the relevant information about the school, such as its funding type and location. Next, we need to compute the average of the average math scores from the 'satscores' table, filtering for schools located in Riverside. The average math score must exceed 400. We can join the 'schools' and 'satscores' tables using the 'CDSCode' field, which serves as the primary key in the 'schools' table and foreign key in the 'satscores' table. We will perform the necessary filtering and aggregation to meet the condition specified. The final output should include only the funding type of these schools. We will retrieve the average math score and the funding type, applying the necessary filtering before grouping and calculating averages.",
