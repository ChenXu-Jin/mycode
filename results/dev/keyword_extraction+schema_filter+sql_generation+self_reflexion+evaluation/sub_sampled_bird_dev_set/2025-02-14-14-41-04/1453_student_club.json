The average parking cost can be calculated by summing the costs of all expenses related to parking and then dividing that sum by the count of those expenses. To achieve this, I will use a subquery to calculate the average parking cost. I will filter the relevant expenses by checking that the category is 'Parking'. Next, I will join the 'event' table with the 'expense' table using the link_to_budget to check the costs associated with each event. Finally, I will select only the event names from the 'event' table where the expenses are below the calculated average. I make sure to follow the provided rules and focus on the required columns only.",
