First, I will filter down the Patient table for females (SEX = 'F') who have been diagnosed with SLE (Diagnosis = 'SLE'). Then, I will need to join this result with the Laboratory table using the Patient ID (ID). Finally, within the Laboratory table, I will apply the filter for PLT > 400 and compute the average of the ALB column for this filtered result. The final SQL query will use AVG function to calculate the average and filter any null values in the ALB and PLT columns to ensure accurate calculations. The result will be a single average value.",
