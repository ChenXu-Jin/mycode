First, I recognize that I need to filter superheroes by height using 'height_cm BETWEEN 150 AND 180'. Then, I will count how many of these superheroes have a 'publisher_id' of 13, which corresponds to Marvel Comics. To calculate the percentage, I will divide the count of Marvel heroes by the total count of heroes in the specified height range, and multiply by 100 to get a percentage. I will utilize the SQL COUNT function for both calculations and make sure to filter out any null values in the main count. The final result is a single calculation representing this percentage.",
