This information is contained in the `Laboratory` table, which has the U-PRO column, and the associated patient information (including the Diagnosis) is stored in the `Patient` table. To achieve this, I will need to join the `Laboratory` table with the `Patient` table based on their common ID column. Since I\u2019m specifically looking for the diagnosis of those patients with the specified proteinuria level, I will include a filter condition for U-PRO in the WHERE clause. Importantly, I will select only the Diagnosis column from the combined result set to match the requirement of only returning relevant information.",
