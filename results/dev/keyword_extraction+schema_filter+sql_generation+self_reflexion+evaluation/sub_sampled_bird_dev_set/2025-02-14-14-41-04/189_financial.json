Next, we will find their birth dates to determine the age, ensuring to get the oldest clients. We will then join the 'district' table to access the average salary data from column A11. After that, we will group the results by account_id to calculate average salaries and filter for the lowest average salary. Finally, we'll select the account numbers from the 'account' table using the joined data. Given that we need specific columns without extraneous information, we will only include the account_id in the SELECT clause.",
