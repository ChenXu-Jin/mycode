This will help us identify the link_to_member who made the purchase. Next, we need to join this information with the 'member' table using the link_to_member to get details about the member such as their last name and position. The necessary fields after filtering the data will be last_name and position from the member table. To accomplish this efficiently, we will use inner join to connect the expense and member tables based on the link_to_member, and then select the required columns while applying the necessary filters.",
