Next, we will identify patients with abnormal fibrinogen levels by checking for FG values that are less than or equal to 150 or greater than or equal to 450. To get the count of unique patients, we'll use the COUNT DISTINCT function. Finally, we'll join the Patient table with the Laboratory table based on the patient ID while ensuring we meet all the criteria mentioned.",
