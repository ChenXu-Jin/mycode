This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the intent of the question, consider the following actionable steps: 1. **Aggregate the Amount of Debt**: If the client may have multiple loans, use an aggregate function to sum the total debt across all loans associated with the client. Modify the SELECT statement to: `SELECT SUM(L.amount) AS total_debt, SUM(L.payments) AS total_payments`. This change ensures you get the total debt and total payments made by the client. 2. **Clarify Payment Status**: If 'payments' refers to individual payments made on loans, you may want to provide a clearer indication of payment status, such as the number of payments made, or suggest adding a conditional statement to show whether the client is behind on payments (for example, comparing total payments to a defined threshold). 3. **Group By Clause**: Add a `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate on the client level: `GROUP BY C.client_id`. This will help summarize the total amounts correctly in case there are multiple records. 4. **Enhance Readability**: Rename the columns in the result set to something more descriptive, like `total_debt` and `total_payments`, for clarity in interpreting results. 5. **Ensure Schema Understanding**: Confirm the meaning of the 'payments' column in your schema to decide how to best represent the payment status in your query. After making these adjustments, the modified query may look something like this: `SELECT SUM(L.amount) AS total_debt, COUNT(L.payments) AS payments_count FROM loan L JOIN account A ON L.account_id = A.account_id JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id WHERE C.client_id = 992 GROUP BY C.client_id;`

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the intent of the question, consider the following actionable steps: 1. **Aggregate the Amount of Debt**: If the client may have multiple loans, use an aggregate function to sum the total debt across all loans associated with the client. Modify the SELECT statement to: `SELECT SUM(L.amount) AS total_debt, SUM(L.payments) AS total_payments`. This change ensures you get the total debt and total payments made by the client. 2. **Clarify Payment Status**: If 'payments' refers to individual payments made on loans, you may want to provide a clearer indication of payment status, such as the number of payments made, or suggest adding a conditional statement to show whether the client is behind on payments (for example, comparing total payments to a defined threshold). 3. **Group By Clause**: Add a `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate on the client level: `GROUP BY C.client_id`. This will help summarize the total amounts correctly in case there are multiple records. 4. **Enhance Readability**: Rename the columns in the result set to something more descriptive, like `total_debt` and `total_payments`, for clarity in interpreting results. 5. **Ensure Schema Understanding**: Confirm the meaning of the 'payments' column in your schema to decide how to best represent the payment status in your query. After making these adjustments, the modified query may look something like this: `SELECT SUM(L.amount) AS total_debt, COUNT(L.payments) AS payments_count FROM loan L JOIN account A ON L.account_id = A.account_id JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id WHERE C.client_id = 992 GROUP BY C.client_id;`
7. To align the SQL query with the question's intent regarding both the total debt and the client's payment performance, consider the following modifications: 1. **Assess Payment Status**: Instead of only summing the payments made, include a condition to evaluate whether there are any overdue payments or if the loans are in default. You may need to add a column from the loan table indicating the due date and compare it with the current date to identify overdue debts. 2. **Provide Payment Performance Metrics**: Instead of just summing payments, you could calculate the payment-to-debt ratio as `(SUM(L.payments) / SUM(L.amount)) * 100`, which represents what percentage of the debt has been paid. This will give a clearer view of the client's payment status. 3. **Remove the Group By Clause**: Since you are querying for a single client, the `GROUP BY C.client_id` can be eliminated to simplify the query. 4. **Example Query**: Here’s an updated example of how the SQL could look: ```sql SELECT SUM(L.amount) AS total_debt, SUM(L.payments) AS total_payments, (SUM(L.payments) / SUM(L.amount)) * 100 AS payment_ratio, CASE WHEN MAX(L.due_date) < CURRENT_DATE THEN 'Overdue' ELSE 'Current' END AS payment_status FROM loan L JOIN account A ON L.account_id = A.account_id JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id WHERE C.client_id = 992; ``` This modified query retrieves total debt, total payments, payment performance ratio, and a simple status indicator for payment performance.
