This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Use a GROUP BY clause to group the results by each male customer's ID (or an equivalent unique identifier). This will allow you to calculate the average salary for each individual. 2. Employ the AVG function in the SELECT statement to compute the average salary for each customer. 3. Add a HAVING clause after the GROUP BY clause to filter for customers with an average salary greater than 8000. 4. Ensure that the JOIN condition accurately links the customer data to the district data based on the district_id as before. Your revised SQL query might look something like this: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client AS T1 JOIN district AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id WHERE T1.gender = 'M' AND T2.A3 = 'North Bohemia' GROUP BY T1.customer_id HAVING AVG(T1.salary) > 8000; This modification will ensure that only those male customers who meet the average salary condition are counted.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.

Question: 
How many male customers who are living in North Bohemia have average salary greater than 8000? 

Hint:
Male means that gender = 'M'; A3 refers to region; A11 pertains to average salary.

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Use a GROUP BY clause to group the results by each male customer's ID (or an equivalent unique identifier). This will allow you to calculate the average salary for each individual. 2. Employ the AVG function in the SELECT statement to compute the average salary for each customer. 3. Add a HAVING clause after the GROUP BY clause to filter for customers with an average salary greater than 8000. 4. Ensure that the JOIN condition accurately links the customer data to the district data based on the district_id as before. Your revised SQL query might look something like this: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client AS T1 JOIN district AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id WHERE T1.gender = 'M' AND T2.A3 = 'North Bohemia' GROUP BY T1.customer_id HAVING AVG(T1.salary) > 8000; This modification will ensure that only those male customers who meet the average salary condition are counted.
7. 1. Identify the correct table for average salary: Ensure that the average salary condition is evaluated against the 'client' table, rather than the 'district' table. If average salary is stored in a different table, ensure to join that table with the 'client' table properly. 
2. Modify the salary condition: Replace 'T2.A11 > 8000' with a condition that correctly computes the average salary from the appropriate column in the 'client' table (e.g., 'T1.salary > 8000'). If you need to calculate the average salary, consider using a subquery or aggregating function. 
3. Use GROUP BY if multiple records exist: If salary is not already aggregated, use an appropriate grouping method to calculate the average salary for each male customer. Ensure that you aggregate by customer ID or another identifier before filtering. 
4. example SQL Modification: Assuming average salary is directly available in the 'client' table, your modified query might look like: 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client AS T1 WHERE T1.gender = 'M' AND T1.district_id IN (SELECT district_id FROM district WHERE A3 = 'North Bohemia') AND T1.salary > 8000;'. 
5. Verify schema: Double-check the database schema to confirm that you are referencing the correct columns for gender, district, and salary.

Short-Term Memory:

Question: 
How many male customers who are living in North Bohemia have average salary greater than 8000? 

Hint:
Male means that gender = 'M'; A3 refers to region; A11 pertains to average salary.

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Use a GROUP BY clause to group the results by each male customer's ID (or an equivalent unique identifier). This will allow you to calculate the average salary for each individual. 2. Employ the AVG function in the SELECT statement to compute the average salary for each customer. 3. Add a HAVING clause after the GROUP BY clause to filter for customers with an average salary greater than 8000. 4. Ensure that the JOIN condition accurately links the customer data to the district data based on the district_id as before. Your revised SQL query might look something like this: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client AS T1 JOIN district AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id WHERE T1.gender = 'M' AND T2.A3 = 'North Bohemia' GROUP BY T1.customer_id HAVING AVG(T1.salary) > 8000; This modification will ensure that only those male customers who meet the average salary condition are counted.
7. 1. Identify the correct table for average salary: Ensure that the average salary condition is evaluated against the 'client' table, rather than the 'district' table. If average salary is stored in a different table, ensure to join that table with the 'client' table properly. 
2. Modify the salary condition: Replace 'T2.A11 > 8000' with a condition that correctly computes the average salary from the appropriate column in the 'client' table (e.g., 'T1.salary > 8000'). If you need to calculate the average salary, consider using a subquery or aggregating function. 
3. Use GROUP BY if multiple records exist: If salary is not already aggregated, use an appropriate grouping method to calculate the average salary for each male customer. Ensure that you aggregate by customer ID or another identifier before filtering. 
4. example SQL Modification: Assuming average salary is directly available in the 'client' table, your modified query might look like: 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client AS T1 WHERE T1.gender = 'M' AND T1.district_id IN (SELECT district_id FROM district WHERE A3 = 'North Bohemia') AND T1.salary > 8000;'. 
5. Verify schema: Double-check the database schema to confirm that you are referencing the correct columns for gender, district, and salary.
8. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these specific steps: 1. Ensure that you are accessing the correct table for salary information, which should be part of the 'client' table (e.g., T1.salary). 2. Change the condition for filtering the salary from 'T2.A11 > 8000' to 'T1.salary > 8000' to accurately check the salary of male customers. 3. Make sure to only count those clients who are male and reside specifically in North Bohemia. The modified SQL query should look like this: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client AS T1 JOIN district AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id WHERE T1.gender = 'M' AND T2.A3 = 'North Bohemia' AND T1.salary > 8000; This revision correctly targets the average salary of male clients instead of mistakenly checking a district-related field.

Question: 
How many male customers who are living in North Bohemia have average salary greater than 8000? 

Hint:
Male means that gender = 'M'; A3 refers to region; A11 pertains to average salary.

    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To answer the question about male customers living in North Bohemia with an average salary greater than 8000, I will follow these steps:\n1. Identify the main entities involved: male customers (from the 'client' table) and their corresponding districts (from the 'district' table).\n2. From the schema, note that 'A3' in the 'district' table refers to regions, and 'A11' corresponds to the average salary. The criteria that need to be satisfied are:\n   - Gender must be 'M'.\n   - The district must match North Bohemia where A3 = 'North Bohemia'.\n   - The average salary must be greater than 8000 where A11 > 8000.\n3. Consequently, I will form a query that joins the 'client' table and the 'district' table using the 'district_id' foreign key, filter results to include only male clients in the specified region, and ensure their salaries exceed the threshold mentioned.\n4. To obtain the count of such customers, a COUNT() function will encapsulate the selection criteria in the querying structure.\n5. The table aliases will be used for conciseness, and I will ensure to apply filters directly on the 'client' (T1) and 'district' (T2) tables accordingly.\n6. Considering these factors, the SQL query will be appropriately structured to retrieve the count of male customers meeting the defined requirements.",
