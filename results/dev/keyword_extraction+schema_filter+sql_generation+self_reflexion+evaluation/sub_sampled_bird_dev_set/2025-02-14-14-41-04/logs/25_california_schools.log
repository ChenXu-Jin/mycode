This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to better align with the question's intent, follow these actionable steps: 1. Include the school names in the SELECT clause by adding s.SchoolName to the fields being selected. 2. Ensure that you are selecting relevant identifiers alongside the funding type to provide a comprehensive output. The modified query should look like this: SELECT s.SchoolName, s.FundingType FROM schools AS s JOIN satscores AS sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds WHERE s.County = 'Riverside' GROUP BY s.SchoolName, s.FundingType HAVING AVG(sc.AvgScrMath) > 400. This way, the query will retrieve both the names of the schools and their corresponding funding types while meeting the average score criteria.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT s.FundingType FROM schools AS s JOIN satscores AS sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds WHERE s.County = 'Riverside' GROUP BY s.FundingType HAVING AVG(sc.AvgScrMath) > 400;

Execution Result:
(None,)

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': 'The question asks for schools in Riverside with an average SAT math score greater than 400 and requests the funding type of these schools. The SQL query filters schools by County (Riverside), groups results by FundingType, and has a condition that averages the math scores from another table (satscores) and checks if they exceed 400. However, the SQL query only selects the funding type without providing the average math score condition in the result. This means it might not directly fulfill the question since it does not produce a list of school names, which was part of the original query intention. Furthermore, there is no indication of how the funding type relates to the average math performance in the results, leading to uncertainty about whether all relevant data is displayed. Therefore, this query fails to provide a comprehensive answer to the question. Hence, it is concluded to be Invalid.', 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query to align it with the intent of the question, you can take the following specific steps: 1. Change the SELECT statement to include the school name, by using 'SELECT s.Name' instead of just 's.FundingType'. 2. Ensure that the GROUP BY clause includes both the 'FundingType' and any other necessary identifiers to distinctly group the school names while allowing their math scores to be aggregated. This way, you'll still be able to group and average the math scores appropriately. 3. Also, modify the HAVING clause to filter schools based on the average math score, ensuring that the average is calculated correctly for selected schools. 4. As a last touch, verify that joins are correctly established between the 'schools' table and the 'satscores' table to accurately reflect relationships and improve query performance. The revised query would look something like: 'SELECT s.Name, s.FundingType FROM schools AS s JOIN satscores AS sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds WHERE s.County = 'Riverside' GROUP BY s.Name, s.FundingType HAVING AVG(sc.AvgScrMath) > 400;'."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to better align with the question's intent, follow these actionable steps: 1. Include the school names in the SELECT clause by adding s.SchoolName to the fields being selected. 2. Ensure that you are selecting relevant identifiers alongside the funding type to provide a comprehensive output. The modified query should look like this: SELECT s.SchoolName, s.FundingType FROM schools AS s JOIN satscores AS sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds WHERE s.County = 'Riverside' GROUP BY s.SchoolName, s.FundingType HAVING AVG(sc.AvgScrMath) > 400. This way, the query will retrieve both the names of the schools and their corresponding funding types while meeting the average score criteria.
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, you need to include the school names in the SELECT statement. Additionally, instead of grouping by the CDSCode alone, consider grouping by both the CDSCode and the school name to ensure that you accurately capture the corresponding funding types for each school. The revised query should look like this: 'SELECT s.Name, s.FundingType FROM schools AS s JOIN satscores AS sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds WHERE s.County = 'Riverside' GROUP BY s.CDSCode, s.Name, s.FundingType HAVING AVG(sc.AvgScrMath) > 400;'. This ensures that you retrieve both the names and funding types of schools that meet the average math score criteria.

Change the SELECT statement to include the school name, by using 'SELECT s.Name' instead of just 's.FundingType'. 2.

Question: 
Name schools in Riverside which the average of average math score for SAT is grater than 400, what is the funding type of these schools? 

Hint:
Average of average math = sum(average math scores) / count(schools).

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To generate the SQL query that answers the question, I first identified that we need to retrieve the names of schools located in Riverside along with their funding types, provided that the average of their average SAT math scores exceeds 400. I considered the `schools` and `satscores` tables for the necessary information. The logic being requested involves calculating the average math score per school, aggregating this data accordingly, and then determining which schools meet the condition set by the question. To achieve this, I would need to join the two tables using the `CDSCode`, which is the common field that links both tables. By grouping the results by school name and funding type, I can then use a HAVING clause to filter out schools that do not meet the average score requirement. It's essential to ensure the selected fields reflect the requirements as closely as possible, including the school name and funding type. After considering all these points and past query structures, I have constructed the following query.",
    "SQL": "SELECT s.School, s.FundingType FROM schools AS s JOIN satscores AS sc ON s.CDSCode = sc.cds WHERE s.County = 'Riverside' GROUP BY s.School, s.FundingType HAVING AVG(sc.AvgScrMath) > 400;"
