This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To accurately calculate the percentage of the cost for the game events, you need to revise the SQL query to use the total budget allocated for game events instead of the count of game events for the denominator. Here are the specific steps to modify the SQL query:

1. **Identify Total Budget:** Modify the query to select the total budget dedicated to game events. You can achieve this by summing up the budget values from the budget table where the event type is 'Game'.
   - Use `SUM(T3.budget_amount)` to get the total budget for game events.
   
2. **Calculate Total Cost for Game Events:** Ensure that you're summing the costs from the `expense` table. The current SQL query seems to be doing this part correctly; just ensure the joining conditions are accurate.
   - Keep `SUM(T2.cost)` to get the total costs associated with the game events.
   
3. **Rewrite the Division Logic:** Instead of using `COUNT(T1.event_id)` for the denominator, substitute it with the calculated total budget allocated for game events.
   - The calculation should now represent `(SUM(T2.cost) / SUM(T3.budget_amount)) * 100` for the percentage of costs relative to the budget.
   
4. **Final SQL Format:** The final SQL query should look something like this:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT (SUM(T2.cost) / NULLIF(SUM(T3.budget_amount), 0)) * 100 AS percentage_cost 
   FROM event T1 
   JOIN budget T3 ON T1.event_id = T3.link_to_event 
   JOIN expense T2 ON T3.budget_id = T2.link_to_budget 
   WHERE T1.type = 'Game';
   ```  
   Utilize `NULLIF(SUM(T3.budget_amount), 0)` to prevent division by zero errors if there's no budget allocated.

Following these steps should ensure that the SQL query accurately answers the question regarding the percentage of costs for game events.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the percentage of the cost for game events. This implies that we need to calculate the total cost of expenses associated with game events and compare that to some form of total budget amount linked to those events. The SQL query attempts to achieve this by summing the costs of expenses associated with game events and dividing it by the total amount from the budgets that are linked to the same events. It correctly joins three tables: event, budget, and expense. The WHERE clause filters the events to only include those of type 'Game', which is appropriate for answering the question. The use of NULLIF in the denominator prevents division by zero, which is a good practice. However, the expected output should show the value of this percentage clearly, reflecting the correct calculation. If executed correctly and if the data either matches the schema or returns expected corresponding results, the output should be aligned correctly with the question. If there are no mismatches in filtering or aggregation, and the execution leads to a logical output, it can be considered Valid. Therefore, based on the logical flow of the SQL query relative to the question, including the calculations involved, it's reasonable to judge that it is indeed correct and valid.",
