This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Database Content:
{'cards': ['id', 'artist', 'asciiName', 'availability', 'borderColor', 'cardKingdomFoilId', 'cardKingdomId', 'colorIdentity', 'colorIndicator', 'colors', 'convertedManaCost', 'duelDeck', 'edhrecRank', 'faceConvertedManaCost', 'faceName', 'flavorName', 'flavorText', 'frameEffects', 'frameVersion', 'hand', 'hasAlternativeDeckLimit', 'hasContentWarning', 'hasFoil', 'hasNonFoil', 'isAlternative', 'isFullArt', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isOversized', 'isPromo', 'isReprint', 'isReserved', 'isStarter', 'isStorySpotlight', 'isTextless', 'isTimeshifted', 'keywords', 'layout', 'leadershipSkills', 'life', 'loyalty', 'manaCost', 'mcmId', 'mcmMetaId', 'mtgArenaId', 'mtgjsonV4Id', 'mtgoFoilId', 'mtgoId', 'multiverseId', 'name', 'number', 'originalReleaseDate', 'originalText', 'originalType', 'otherFaceIds', 'power', 'printings', 'promoTypes', 'purchaseUrls', 'rarity', 'scryfallId', 'scryfallIllustrationId', 'scryfallOracleId', 'setCode', 'side', 'subtypes', 'supertypes', 'tcgplayerProductId', 'text', 'toughness', 'type', 'types', 'uuid', 'variations', 'watermark'], 'foreign_data': ['id', 'flavorText', 'language', 'multiverseid', 'name', 'text', 'type', 'uuid'], 'legalities': ['id', 'format', 'status', 'uuid'], 'sets': ['id', 'baseSetSize', 'block', 'booster', 'code', 'isFoilOnly', 'isForeignOnly', 'isNonFoilOnly', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isPartialPreview', 'keyruneCode', 'mcmId', 'mcmIdExtras', 'mcmName', 'mtgoCode', 'name', 'parentCode', 'releaseDate', 'tcgplayerGroupId', 'totalSetSize', 'type'], 'set_translations': ['id', 'language', 'setCode', 'translation'], 'rulings': ['id', 'date', 'text', 'uuid']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Correct the spelling of the artist's name in the query from 'Stephen Daniele' to 'Stephen Daniel'. This will ensure that the query matches the intended artist mentioned in the question. 

2. Include a condition in the WHERE clause to check for any properties and values that might be 'missing' or 'degraded'. This may involve checking specific columns in the 'cards' table that indicate the status of properties and values. For example, you could add conditions like 'T1.property IS NULL OR T1.value IS NULL' or similar conditions, based on the schema of your database. 

3. Confirm that all necessary columns are being selected to fulfill the information requested, such as any relevant card properties that define whether they are missing or degraded.

4. Finally, verify if additional joins with other tables might be necessary to retrieve information about properties, assuming they are stored in a separate table. 

By applying these adjustments, the SQL query will be able to accurately answer the question posed.

Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;

Database Content:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Correct the spelling of the artist's name in the query from 'Stephen Daniele' to 'Stephen Daniel'. This will ensure that the query matches the intended artist mentioned in the question. 

2. Include a condition in the WHERE clause to check for any properties and values that might be 'missing' or 'degraded'. This may involve checking specific columns in the 'cards' table that indicate the status of properties and values. For example, you could add conditions like 'T1.property IS NULL OR T1.value IS NULL' or similar conditions, based on the schema of your database. 

3. Confirm that all necessary columns are being selected to fulfill the information requested, such as any relevant card properties that define whether they are missing or degraded.

4. Finally, verify if additional joins with other tables might be necessary to retrieve information about properties, assuming they are stored in a separate table. 

By applying these adjustments, the SQL query will be able to accurately answer the question posed.
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, consider the following steps: 1. **Join Additional Table**: Ensure that you join the appropriate table that contains information about the properties and values of the cards. This could be a table like 'card_properties' that should be joined based on a common key (e.g., card ID or UUID). 2. **Select Relevant Properties**: Update the SELECT clause to include the necessary details regarding the properties and values, such as missing properties or degraded values, in addition to the text of the rulings. For example, you might want to include fields like 'T3.property_status' or 'T3.degraded_value' from the new table. 3. **Add Conditions**: Include specific conditions in the WHERE clause or additional JOINs to filter based on the status of the properties or values (e.g., whether they are missing or degraded), ensuring that these aspects are covered. 4. **Check for Content Warning Logic**: Revise the condition regarding the content warning if it is necessary for all cards or if it should be optional. This might include checking if `hasContentWarning` is either 1 or 0 based on what specifically needs to be reported. For example, the query might look like: 

```sql
SELECT T1.id, T2.text, T3.property_status, T3.degraded_value 
FROM cards T1 
JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid 
JOIN card_properties T3 ON T1.id = T3.card_id 
WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel';
``` 
After implementing these changes, ensure to test the query to check for the expected results.
8. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, make the following modifications: 1. Remove the condition that filters cards by 'hasContentWarning = 1'. Instead, select all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel without this restriction. This will ensure that you capture all relevant cards regardless of their content warning status. 2. Add a selection to check for missing or degraded properties and values of the cards. This may involve including columns such as `hasMissingProperties` or a similar identifier that indicates whether the card has degraded values. 3. If specific columns do not exist, you may need to compute or denote missing or degraded values using appropriate case statements or flags in your SELECT clause. The modified query may look like this: SELECT T1.id, T2.text, T1.hasMissingProperties FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel'; This format will properly address all elements of the question.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniele' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;", "SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;", "SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;", "SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;", "SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;"]

Question: 
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values. 

Hint:
cards have missing or degraded properties and value refers to hasContentWarning = 1; 'Stephen Daniele' is artist;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
