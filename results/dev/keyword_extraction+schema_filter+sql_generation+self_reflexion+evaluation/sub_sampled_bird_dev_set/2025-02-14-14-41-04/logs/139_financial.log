This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to correctly align with the question's intent of counting all high-level credit cards with 'disponent' type of disposition, follow these actionable steps: 1. Define what 'high-level' credit cards include. If multiple types exist, such as 'gold', 'platinum', etc., update the SQL query to include all relevant types instead of just 'gold'. You can use the IN clause to specify multiple high-level types. 2. Ensure that you're still joining the `disp` table correctly to filter for the 'disponent' disposition type. 3. The corrected SQL query would look like: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card AS T1 JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'other_high_level_type') AND T2.type = 'disponent'; Replace 'other_high_level_type' with any additional high-level types if they exist. 4.

2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to correctly align with the question's intent of counting all high-level credit cards with 'disponent' type of disposition, follow these actionable steps: 1. Define what 'high-level' credit cards include. If multiple types exist, such as 'gold', 'platinum', etc., update the SQL query to include all relevant types instead of just 'gold'. You can use the IN clause to specify multiple high-level types. 2. Ensure that you're still joining the `disp` table correctly to filter for the 'disponent' disposition type. 3. The corrected SQL query would look like: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card AS T1 JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'other_high_level_type') AND T2.type = 'disponent'; Replace 'other_high_level_type' with any additional high-level types if they exist. 4. Validate the results by checking if the returned count aligns with your expectations based on known data.
7. Modify the SQL query to include all types of high-level credit cards instead of only those of type 'gold'. This can be achieved by either defining a list of all high-level card types in the WHERE clause or by using a more inclusive condition that captures all relevant categories. For example, you could adjust the SQL to encompass multiple high-level card types such as 'gold', 'platinum', and 'diamond' if those are considered high-level. The modified query would look like this: 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card AS T1 JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'diamond') AND T2.type = 'disponent';'. Ensure that you verify the definitions of high-level cards based on your database schema to include all relevant categories.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.

The 'card' table contains the 'type' column, while the 'disp' table holds 'type' that could match 'disponent'. I also need the foreign key connections to ensure I'm counting correctly associated records.

For example: 'silver', 'gold', 'platinum', 'black', etc., if those types are the standard high-level classifications in your database. The revised SQL may look something like: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM card AS T1 JOIN disp AS T2 ON T1.disp_id = T2.disp_id WHERE T1.type IN ('gold', 'platinum', 'black') AND T2.type = 'disponent'; 3. Finally, verify that both tables contain the necessary fields and that the JOIN condition remains valid for your dataset.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To generate the SQL query for counting the number of high-level credit cards with a 'disponent' type of disposition, I first analyze the question to understand that high-level credit cards specifically refer to those of 'gold' type, as indicated in the hint. Next, I need to join the `card` table with the `disp` table using the disp_id to filter for the disposition type 'disponent'. The `COUNT(*)` function is used to return the total count that meets these criteria. I ensure the WHERE clause properly reflects both conditions: the card type being 'gold' and the disposition type being 'disponent'. Utilizing the guiding principles from long-term memory, I will use a proper JOIN syntax without including unnecessary columns, focusing solely on the count. Thus, the SQL query with the necessary conditions is structured to join the appropriate tables and filter correctly.",
