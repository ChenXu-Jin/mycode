This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure the SQL query aligns with the question's intent and retrieves the desired results, consider the following modifications: 

1. **Aggregate Results**: Instead of limiting to only one account, modify the query to first identify all accounts approved in 1997 that have a 'weekly' issuance frequency. Use a subquery to find the minimum approved amount and then select accounts with that amount. 
    - Example: 
    ```sql 
    SELECT T1.account_id 
    FROM loan AS T1 
    JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
    WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997' 
    AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE' 
    AND T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(amount) 
                     FROM loan 
                     WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '1997' 
                     AND account_id IN (SELECT account_id 
                                       FROM account 
                                       WHERE frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE')) 
    ``` 

2. **Clarify Frequency**: Ensure that 'POPLATEK TYDNE' indeed corresponds to weekly issuance. If unsure, confirm the frequency description with data dictionary or business terminology to prevent incorrect filtering. 

3. **Return Complete Information**: If possible, modify the SELECT clause to return additional information like the approved amount alongside the account ID for clarity and validation. 
   - Example: 
   ```sql 
   SELECT T1.account_id, T1.amount 
   FROM loan AS T1 
   JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
   WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997' 
   AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE' 
   AND T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(amount) 
                    FROM loan

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure the SQL query aligns with the question's intent and retrieves the desired results, consider the following modifications: 

1. **Aggregate Results**: Instead of limiting to only one account, modify the query to first identify all accounts approved in 1997 that have a 'weekly' issuance frequency. Use a subquery to find the minimum approved amount and then select accounts with that amount. 
    - Example: 
    ```sql 
    SELECT T1.account_id 
    FROM loan AS T1 
    JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
    WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997' 
    AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE' 
    AND T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(amount) 
                     FROM loan 
                     WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '1997' 
                     AND account_id IN (SELECT account_id 
                                       FROM account 
                                       WHERE frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE')) 
    ``` 

2. **Clarify Frequency**: Ensure that 'POPLATEK TYDNE' indeed corresponds to weekly issuance. If unsure, confirm the frequency description with data dictionary or business terminology to prevent incorrect filtering. 

3. **Return Complete Information**: If possible, modify the SELECT clause to return additional information like the approved amount alongside the account ID for clarity and validation. 
   - Example: 
   ```sql 
   SELECT T1.account_id, T1.amount 
   FROM loan AS T1 
   JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
   WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997' 
   AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE' 
   AND T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(amount) 
                    FROM loan 
                    WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '1997' 
                    AND account_id IN (SELECT account_id 
                                      FROM account 
                                      WHERE frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE')) 
   ``` 

By following these steps, the query will more accurately address the question’s requirements and provide the necessary details.
7. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps:
1. **Identify the Lowest Approved Amount**: First, obtain the minimum approved amount for all accounts having loans approved in 1997.
    - Use a subquery to retrieve the minimum approved amount: `SELECT MIN(T1.amount) AS min_amount FROM loan AS T1 WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997'`.

2. **Filter by Accounts with the Lowest Approved Amount**: Modify the main query to select all account IDs that have the approved amount equal to this minimum value.
    - You can incorporate the minimum amount subquery in a WHERE clause: `WHERE T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(T1.amount) FROM loan AS T1 WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997')`.

3. **Ensure Weekly Issuance Statement Context**: Verify the frequency condition is aligned with 'weekly issuance statement'. Ensure 'POPLATEK TYDNE' is indeed the correct value for weekly frequency. Consider if there might be other frequency values representing 'weekly' that need to be included.

4. **Final Query Structure**: Combine the modifications. The adjusted SQL might look like this:
```sql
SELECT T2.account_id 
FROM loan AS T1 
JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997' 
AND T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(T1.amount) FROM loan AS T1 WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997') 
AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE';
``` 
5. **Test the Query**: Once modified, execute the query to ensure it returns all relevant accounts meeting the conditions outlined in the question.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
Among the accounts who have approved loan date in 1997, list out the accounts that have the lowest approved amount and choose weekly issuance statement.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT T2.account_id FROM loan AS T1 JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997' AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE' AND T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(T1.amount) FROM loan AS T1 WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997')

Execution Result:
None

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': "First, I analyzed the question. It specifically asks for accounts with approved loans in 1997 that also have the lowest approved amount and mentions choosing records with a frequency of 'POPLATEK TYDNE'.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure the SQL query aligns with the question's intent and retrieves the desired results, consider the following modifications: 

1. **Aggregate Results**: Instead of limiting to only one account, modify the query to first identify all accounts approved in 1997 that have a 'weekly' issuance frequency. Use a subquery to find the minimum approved amount and then select accounts with that amount. 
    - Example: 
    ```sql 
    SELECT T1.account_id 
    FROM loan AS T1 
    JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
    WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997' 
    AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE' 
    AND T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(amount) 
                     FROM loan 
                     WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '1997' 
                     AND account_id IN (SELECT account_id 
                                       FROM account 
                                       WHERE frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE')) 
    ``` 

2. **Clarify Frequency**: Ensure that 'POPLATEK TYDNE' indeed corresponds to weekly issuance. If unsure, confirm the frequency description with data dictionary or business terminology to prevent incorrect filtering. 

3. **Return Complete Information**: If possible, modify the SELECT clause to return additional information like the approved amount alongside the account ID for clarity and validation. 
   - Example: 
   ```sql 
   SELECT T1.account_id, T1.amount 
   FROM loan AS T1 
   JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
   WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997' 
   AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE' 
   AND T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(amount) 
                    FROM loan 
                    WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '1997' 
                    AND account_id IN (SELECT account_id 
                                      FROM account 
                                      WHERE frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE')) 
   ``` 

By following these steps, the query will more accurately address the question’s requirements and provide the necessary details.
7. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps:
1. **Identify the Lowest Approved Amount**: First, obtain the minimum approved amount for all accounts having loans approved in 1997.
    - Use a subquery to retrieve the minimum approved amount: `SELECT MIN(T1.amount) AS min_amount FROM loan AS T1 WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997'`.

2. **Filter by Accounts with the Lowest Approved Amount**: Modify the main query to select all account IDs that have the approved amount equal to this minimum value.
    - You can incorporate the minimum amount subquery in a WHERE clause: `WHERE T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(T1.amount) FROM loan AS T1 WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997')`.

3. **Ensure Weekly Issuance Statement Context**: Verify the frequency condition is aligned with 'weekly issuance statement'. Ensure 'POPLATEK TYDNE' is indeed the correct value for weekly frequency. Consider if there might be other frequency values representing 'weekly' that need to be included.

4. **Final Query Structure**: Combine the modifications. The adjusted SQL might look like this:
```sql
SELECT T2.account_id 
FROM loan AS T1 
JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id 
WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997' 
AND T1.amount = (SELECT MIN(T1.amount) FROM loan AS T1 WHERE strftime('%Y', T1.date) = '1997') 
AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE';
``` 
5. **Test the Query**: Once modified, execute the query to ensure it returns all relevant accounts meeting the conditions outlined in the question.
8. 1. Modify the subquery to avoid using the same alias for both the outer query and the subquery, which causes confusion. Instead of using 'T1' in both places, keep the alias for the outer query and call the subquery directly from the 'loan' table. 

2. Include the 'amount' in the SELECT statement of the outer query, so the results will show the lowest approved amount along with the account IDs. This allows you to directly see which accounts have the lowest amount approved.

3. Use a GROUP BY clause or consider using a CTE (Common Table Expression) to first filter all loans approved in 1997, then calculate the minimum amount, and finally join with the account table to get the specific account details. 

4. Ensure the condition for the frequency 'POPLATEK TYDNE' is applied correctly to get results relevant to that specific criteria.

5. Structure the SQL query as follows:

```sql
WITH MinAmount AS (  
    SELECT MIN(amount) AS min_amount  
    FROM loan  
    WHERE strftime('%Y', date) = '1997'  
)  
SELECT T2.account_id, T1.amount  
FROM loan AS T1  
JOIN account AS T2 ON T1.account_id = T2.account_id  
WHERE T1.amount = (SELECT min_amount FROM MinAmount)  
AND T2.frequency = 'POPLATEK TYDNE';
``` 
This revised query first defines a common table expression (CTE) to find the minimum approved amount for loans in 1997. Then, it selects account IDs and corresponding amounts where the amount matches the minimum, ensuring the frequency requirement is respected.

Question: 
Among the accounts who have approved loan date in 1997, list out the accounts that have the lowest approved amount and choose weekly issuance statement. 

Hint:
'POPLATEK TYDNE' stands for weekly issuance
