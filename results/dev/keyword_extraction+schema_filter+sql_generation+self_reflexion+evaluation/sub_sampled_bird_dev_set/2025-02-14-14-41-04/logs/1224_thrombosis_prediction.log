This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query and align it with the question's intent, you should adjust the WHERE clause to include a condition that captures all patients who share the maximum total bilirubin level, rather than just one patient whose T-BIL equals that maximum value. You can achieve this by using a subquery to derive the maximum T-BIL value and then selecting all patient records whose T-BIL level matches this maximum. Here’s the revised query:

SELECT P.ID, P.SEX, P.Birthday 
FROM Patient P 
JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID 
WHERE L.`T-BIL` IN (SELECT MAX(`T-BIL`) FROM Laboratory WHERE `T-BIL` IS NOT NULL);

This modification switches from '=' to 'IN', which allows the query to return all patients that have the highest T-BIL level, ensuring completeness of the results.

The final SQL query will have proper JOINs and filters to ensure that we're capturing the correct records without errors or extraneous data.", 'SQL': 'SELECT P.ID, P.SEX, P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.`T-BIL` = (SELECT MAX(`T-BIL`) FROM Laboratory WHERE `T-BIL` IS NOT NULL)'}, 'SELECT P.ID, P.SEX, P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.`T-BIL` = (SELECT MAX(`T-BIL`) FROM Laboratory WHERE `T-BIL` IS NOT NULL)']

Question: 
What is the highest total bilirubin level recorded? List out the patient details with ID, sex and birthday with that index. 

Hint:
the highest total bilirubin refers to MAX(T-BIL)

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Input Data

Question:
What is the highest total bilirubin level recorded? List out the patient details with ID, sex and birthday with that index.

SQL Query:
SELECT P.ID, P.SEX, P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.`T-BIL` IN (SELECT MAX(`T-BIL`) FROM Laboratory WHERE `T-BIL` IS NOT NULL);

Database Content:
{'Examination': ['ID', 'Examination Date', 'aCL IgG', 'aCL IgM', 'ANA', 'ANA Pattern', 'aCL IgA', 'Diagnosis', 'KCT', 'RVVT', 'LAC', 'Symptoms', 'Thrombosis'], 'Patient': ['ID', 'SEX', 'Birthday', 'Description', 'First Date', 'Admission', 'Diagnosis'], 'Laboratory': ['ID', 'Date', 'GOT', 'GPT', 'LDH', 'ALP', 'TP', 'ALB', 'UA', 'UN', 'CRE', 'T-BIL', 'T-CHO', 'TG', 'CPK', 'GLU', 'WBC', 'RBC', 'HGB', 'HCT', 'PLT', 'PT', 'APTT', 'FG', 'PIC', 'TAT', 'TAT2', 'U-PRO', 'IGG', 'IGA', 'IGM', 'CRP', 'RA', 'RF', 'C3', 'C4', 'RNP', 'SM', 'SC170', 'SSA', 'SSB', 'CENTROMEA', 'DNA', 'DNA-II']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the highest total bilirubin level recorded and requests patient details (ID, sex, and birthday) associated with that bilirubin level. The SQL query starts by selecting the patient information from the Patient table, joining it with the Laboratory table based on the matching patient ID. It uses a subquery that retrieves the maximum 'T-BIL' value to filter the records. This structure ensures that it will return patients who have the highest total bilirubin level. However, the use of 'IN' makes the implication that there could be multiple records with the maximum 'T-BIL', which is important for capturing all patients with that level. Thus, the main intent of the question is satisfied: it lists patient details related to the highest total bilirubin recorded. There are no critical omissions or errors detected in the SQL query's alignment with the question. Therefore, I conclude that the SQL query correctly answers the question.",
    "judgment": "Valid"
