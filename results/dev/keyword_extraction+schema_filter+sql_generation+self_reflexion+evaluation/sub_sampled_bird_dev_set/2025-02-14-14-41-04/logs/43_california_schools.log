This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. First, calculate the average scores for all subjects (math, reading, and writing) per school. This requires using an aggregation function. 2. Next, compute the overall average score for each school by averaging the individual subject scores. 3. Identify the school with the lowest overall average score using a 'HAVING' clause after grouping. 4. Finally, select the average math score and the corresponding county for that specific school. Here is a modified SQL query that incorporates these steps: 

```
SELECT T1.AvgScrMath, T2.County 
FROM ( 
    SELECT cds, 
           AVG(AvgScrMath) AS AvgScrMath, 
           AVG(AvgScrRead) AS AvgScrRead, 
           AVG(AvgScrWrite) AS AvgScrWrite, 
           (AVG(AvgScrMath) + AVG(AvgScrRead) + AVG(AvgScrWrite)) / 3 AS OverallAvg 
    FROM satscores 
    WHERE AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL AND AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL AND AvgScrWrite IS NOT NULL 
    GROUP BY cds 
) AS T1 
JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.cds = T2.CDSCode 
ORDER BY T1.OverallAvg ASC 
LIMIT 1; 
```
This would correctly return the average math score of the school with the lowest average score across all subjects, along with the associated county.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. First, calculate the average scores for all subjects (math, reading, and writing) per school. This requires using an aggregation function. 2. Next, compute the overall average score for each school by averaging the individual subject scores. 3. Identify the school with the lowest overall average score using a 'HAVING' clause after grouping. 4. Finally, select the average math score and the corresponding county for that specific school. Here is a modified SQL query that incorporates these steps: 

```
SELECT T1.AvgScrMath, T2.County 
FROM ( 
    SELECT cds, 
           AVG(AvgScrMath) AS AvgScrMath, 
           AVG(AvgScrRead) AS AvgScrRead, 
           AVG(AvgScrWrite) AS AvgScrWrite, 
           (AVG(AvgScrMath) + AVG(AvgScrRead) + AVG(AvgScrWrite)) / 3 AS OverallAvg 
    FROM satscores 
    WHERE AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL AND AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL AND AvgScrWrite IS NOT NULL 
    GROUP BY cds 
) AS T1 
JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.cds = T2.CDSCode 
ORDER BY T1.OverallAvg ASC 
LIMIT 1; 
```
This would correctly return the average math score of the school with the lowest average score across all subjects, along with the associated county.
7. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure the subquery calculates the overall average score correctly; this part is handled adequately. 2. Instead of returning both the overall average and the average math score in the subquery, only return the average math score and the overall average to eliminate confusion. 3. Select only the specific average math score of the school with the lowest average across all subjects in the final output. 4. Modify the SELECT statement to ensure that the average math score is clearly referenced. 5. Replace the ORDER BY clause to ensure you're directly identifying the school with the lowest overall average in a clearer way. The modified query could look like: `SELECT AvgScrMath, County FROM (SELECT T2.County, (AVG(AvgScrMath) + AVG(AvgScrRead) + AVG(AvgScrWrite)) / 3 AS OverallAvg, AvgScrMath FROM satscores T1 JOIN schools T2 ON T1.cds = T2.CDSCode WHERE AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL AND AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL AND AvgScrWrite IS NOT NULL GROUP BY T1.cds, T2.County) AS subquery ORDER BY OverallAvg ASC LIMIT 1;` This way, the query ensures it presents the correct average math score of the identified lowest-scoring school as well as the county it belongs to.
8. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Instead of calculating the average for each subject in the inner query, focus only on the overall average score across all subjects using the provided scores (math, reading, writing). Ensure this overall score is computed correctly for each school; you're already doing this in your current query. 2. Rename the `OverallAvg` to something more indicative of its purpose, such as `TotalOverallAvg`, to avoid confusion. 3. Use a WHERE clause or a HAVING clause in your outer query to ensure that you're specifically fetching information only if the aggregated score is the lowest overall average score, not just the mathematical average of scores. 4. Select the `AvgScrMath` only after confirming that this is from the school having the lowest overall average computed score. Consider adding an additional `LIMIT 1` to ensure you are returning only the school with the lowest average correctly. 5. Finally, ensure all necessary columns (like `County`) are being selected and properly joined to give clarity about which school is being referenced. Your modified query should look something like: `SELECT T1.AvgScrMath, T2.County FROM (SELECT cds, AVG((AvgScrMath + AvgScrRead + AvgScrWrite) / 3) AS TotalOverallAvg, AVG(AvgScrMath) AS AvgScrMath FROM satscores WHERE AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL AND AvgScrRead IS NOT NULL AND AvgScrWrite IS NOT NULL GROUP BY cds ORDER BY TotalOverallAvg ASC LIMIT 1) AS T1 JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.cds = T2.CDSCode;` This structure ensures you directly retrieve both the required average math score and the county of the school with the lowest score across all subjects.
