This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of Story Spotlight cards in a separate CTE (Common Table Expression) or subquery, which will help in organizing the data for clearer reference. 2. Retrieve the IDs of the Story Spotlight cards and count those that also have a text box in a separate count in the same manner. 3. Rather than attempting to compute the percentage for each individual card, calculate the percentage of those with a text box relative to the total number of Story Spotlight cards in a final SELECT statement. 4. Ensure to group all the necessary SQL components logically to present the final output as desired according to the question. Updated SQL might look like: 

WITH TotalCount AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_story_spotlight FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1), 
FilteredCards AS (SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS text_box_count FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1 AND isTextless = 1 GROUP BY id) 
SELECT T1.id, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FilteredCards) * 100.0 / (SELECT total_story_spotlight FROM TotalCount) AS percentage_textless_story_spotlight 
FROM FilteredCards T1;

The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of Story Spotlight cards that are textless by the total count of Story Spotlight cards, then multiplying by 100. I will use a subquery to count the total number of Story Spotlight cards, and then filter for those that are textless. Also, since the question asks for IDs of these cards, I will select the ID of the cards that meet the criteria as well. I will also consider NULL filtering on relevant boolean columns to avoid miscalculations. Therefore, I will write a query that selects the ID of Story Spotlight cards that are textless and calculates the percentage based on the full count of Story Spotlight cards.', 'SQL': 'SELECT T1.id, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1) AS total_story_spotlight_cards, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1 AND isTextless = 1) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1) AS percentage_textless_story_spotlight FROM cards T1 WHERE T1.isStorySpotlight = 1 AND T1.isTextless = 1;'}, 'SELECT T1.id, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1) AS total_story_spotlight_cards, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1 AND isTextless = 1) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1) AS percentage_textless_story_spotlight FROM cards T1 WHERE T1.isStorySpotlight = 1 AND T1.isTextless = 1;']

Question: 
What is the percentage of Story Spotlight cards that also have a text box? List them by their ID. 

Hint:
Story Spotlight cards that do not have a text box refers to isStorylight = 1 and isTextless = 1; Percentage refer to DIVIDE(SUM(count(id) where isStorylight = 1), SUM(count(id))) * 100



Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Here's an updated version of the SQL query: WITH TotalCount AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_story_spotlight FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1), FilteredCards AS (SELECT id FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1 AND isTextless = 0) SELECT T1.id, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FilteredCards) * 100.0 / (SELECT total_story_spotlight FROM TotalCount) AS percentage_text_boxes_story_spotlight FROM FilteredCards T1; This approach allows you to preserve the unique IDs in the output while providing a single, consistent percentage value applicable to all returned records.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total number of Story Spotlight cards in a separate CTE (Common Table Expression) or subquery, which will help in organizing the data for clearer reference. 2. Retrieve the IDs of the Story Spotlight cards and count those that also have a text box in a separate count in the same manner. 3. Rather than attempting to compute the percentage for each individual card, calculate the percentage of those with a text box relative to the total number of Story Spotlight cards in a final SELECT statement. 4. Ensure to group all the necessary SQL components logically to present the final output as desired according to the question. Updated SQL might look like: 

WITH TotalCount AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_story_spotlight FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1), 
FilteredCards AS (SELECT id, COUNT(*) AS text_box_count FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1 AND isTextless = 1 GROUP BY id) 
SELECT T1.id, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FilteredCards) * 100.0 / (SELECT total_story_spotlight FROM TotalCount) AS percentage_textless_story_spotlight 
FROM FilteredCards T1;
7. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these specific steps: 1. Instead of calculating the percentage in the SELECT clause, you should join the filtered cards with the total count only once to provide a consistent percentage for all Story Spotlight cards with a text box. 2. Revise the calculation to utilize a window function or a CROSS JOIN so that each card can preserve its unique ID while still sharing the overall percentage. 3. Ensure that the output includes the card ID together with the static percentage (which could be derived from an overall calculation, as all IDs will share the same percentage based on the input structure). 4. Here's an updated version of the SQL query: WITH TotalCount AS (SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_story_spotlight FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1), FilteredCards AS (SELECT id FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1 AND isTextless = 0) SELECT T1.id, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FilteredCards) * 100.0 / (SELECT total_story_spotlight FROM TotalCount) AS percentage_text_boxes_story_spotlight FROM FilteredCards T1; This approach allows you to preserve the unique IDs in the output while providing a single, consistent percentage value applicable to all returned records.
8. 1. Separate the logic for filtering Story Spotlight cards with text boxes from calculating the percentage. First, gather the IDs of the Story Spotlight cards that have associated text boxes. 2. Use a simple SELECT statement to pull the IDs from the FilteredCards CTE. 3. After that, calculate the percentage of those filtered cards relative to the total Story Spotlight cards in a separate query or in a simpler manner in the main query. 4. Ensure that the final output includes one column for the IDs of these Story Spotlight cards and one for the calculated percentage. This approach clearly separates the identification of the cards from the aggregation of data. Lastly, check that the condition for 'isTextless' accurately reflects having a text box.

Question: 
What is the percentage of Story Spotlight cards that also have a text box? List them by their ID. 

Hint:
Story Spotlight cards that do not have a text box refers to isStorylight = 1 and isTextless = 1; Percentage refer to DIVIDE(SUM(count(id) where isStorylight = 1), SUM(count(id))) * 100
