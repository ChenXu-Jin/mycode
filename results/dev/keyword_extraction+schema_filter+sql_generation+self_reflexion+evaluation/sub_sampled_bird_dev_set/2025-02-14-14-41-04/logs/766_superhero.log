  foreign key (alignment_id) references alignment(id),
  foreign key (eye_colour_id) references colour(id),
  foreign key (gender_id) references gender(id),
  foreign key (hair_colour_id) references colour(id),
  foreign key (publisher_id) references publisher(id),
  foreign key (race_id) references race(id),
  foreign key (skin_colour_id) references colour(id)
);

CREATE TABLE hero_attribute (
  hero_id         INTEGER default NULL,

  foreign key (power_id) references superpower(id)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
What is the hero's full name with the highest attribute in strength?

SQL Query:
SELECT T3.full_name FROM hero_attribute T1 JOIN attribute T2 ON T1.attribute_id = T2.id JOIN superhero T3 ON T1.hero_id = T3.id WHERE T2.attribute_name = 'strength' ORDER BY T1.attribute_value DESC LIMIT 1;

Database Content:
{'alignment': ['id', 'alignment'], 'attribute': ['id', 'attribute_name', 'attributename'], 'colour': ['id', 'colour'], 'gender': ['id', 'gender'], 'publisher': ['id', 'publisher_name'], 'race': ['id', 'race'], 'superhero': ['id', 'superhero_name', 'full_name', 'gender_id', 'eye_colour_id', 'hair_colour_id', 'skin_colour_id', 'race_id', 'publisher_id', 'alignment_id', 'height_cm', 'weight_kg'], 'hero_attribute': ['hero_id', 'attribute_id', 'attribute_value', 'attributevalue'], 'superpower': ['id', 'power_name'], 'hero_power': ['hero_id', 'power_id']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

############################## AI at step evaluator_generate_result ##############################

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the hero's full name with the highest strength attribute. The SQL query uses a JOIN between hero_attribute, attribute, and superhero tables to find heroes' full names based on their strength attribute. The query specifically filters by the attribute_name 'strength' and orders the results by attribute_value in descending order, limiting the output to just one result using LIMIT 1. This approach directly addresses the question by focusing on strength attributes and selecting the hero with the highest strength. Additionally, the SQL query references the correct columns: full_name from the superhero table and appropriate joins to correlate heroes with their attributes. Given this structured approach, the SQL query appears to correctly align with the question's requirements. Therefore, the query successfully answers the question.",
    "judgment": "Valid"
