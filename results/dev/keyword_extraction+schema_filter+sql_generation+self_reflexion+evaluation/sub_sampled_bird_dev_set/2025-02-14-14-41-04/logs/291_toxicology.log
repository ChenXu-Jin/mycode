You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to accurately count the carcinogenic compounds in the database, consider the following actionable steps: 1. **Understand the Labels**: Review the data dictionary or documentation related to the 'molecule' table to determine all possible labels that indicate a compound is carcinogenic. Ensure that you include all valid identifiers for carcinogenicity, not just the '+' label. 2. **Revise the WHERE Clause**: Modify the WHERE clause to include all relevant labels that identify a compound as carcinogenic. For example, you might need to use an IN clause to include multiple labels like this: `WHERE T1.label IN ('+', 'carcinogen', 'potential_carcinogen')`. 3. **Ensure Data Completeness**: Check if there are any additional columns or tables that may provide insights into the carcinogenic classification. If there's a separate classification table, consider using a JOIN operation to get a comprehensive count of carcinogenic compounds. 4. **Test the Modified Query**: After implementing changes, run the revised query to validate that it accurately reflects the count of carcinogenic compounds as intended. An example updated query could be: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule AS T1 WHERE T1.label IN ('+', 'carcinogen', 'potential_carcinogen');`.
7. To modify the SQL query so that it accurately reflects the question intent of counting carcinogenic chemical compounds, follow these steps: 1. Review the database schema to identify the column that indicates whether a compound is carcinogenic. This might be a specific column like 'is_carcinogenic', 'carcinogen_status', or something similar. 2. Update the SQL query to use this relevant column in the WHERE clause instead of the ambiguous label. For example, if the column is named 'is_carcinogenic' and uses boolean values, the query should be: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule AS T1 WHERE T1.is_carcinogenic = true;` If it uses categorical values, make sure to filter by the correct value that denotes carcinogenicity. 3. Finally, ensure that the query is tested to confirm that it returns the correct count based on the defined criteria of carcinogenic compounds.
8. To modify the SQL query to accurately count the number of chemical compounds identified as carcinogenic, follow these steps: 1. Verify the schema of the 'molecule' table to confirm that there is a specific identifier for carcinogenic compounds. This may be a different column or a more explicit label. 2. If a different column is available that clearly indicates carcinogenicity (e.g., a boolean column or an integer representing classifications), use that instead. For instance, if there is a column called 'is_carcinogenic' that stores boolean values, the query should be modified to: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule AS T1 WHERE T1.is_carcinogenic = TRUE;` 3. If 'label' indeed denotes the carcinogenic property, clarify what each label represents in the documentation. Assuming '+' indicates carcinogenicity, the query can be modified to: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule AS T1 WHERE T1.label = 'carcinogenic';` or `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM molecule AS T1 WHERE T1.label = '+' AND T1.type = 'carcinogenic';`, depending on the actual labels defined in the schema. 4. Ensure the new query definition explicitly states what counts as carcinogenic based on the established labels or fields.

    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "First, I reviewed the database schema to identify how compounds are classified as carcinogenic. The 'molecule' table has a 'label' column which indicates carcinogenicity, with '+' representing carcinogenic compounds.

I need to ensure that I accurately reflect the query based on the understanding that records with label '+' should be counted. As per my long-term memory, I'll avoid aggregating unnecessary columns and focus only on the count.
