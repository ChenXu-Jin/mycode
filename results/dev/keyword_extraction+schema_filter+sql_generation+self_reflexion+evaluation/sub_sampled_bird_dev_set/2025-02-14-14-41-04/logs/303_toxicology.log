You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to meet the requirements of the question, follow these actionable steps: 1.

Update the query as follows: SELECT COUNT(T2.bond_id) AS double_bond_count, T1.carcinogenic AS is_carcinogenic FROM molecule AS T1 JOIN bond AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR006' AND T2.bond_type = 'double'; 4. Finally, verify that the database schema provides the necessary fields for carcinogenicity and that the bond types are correctly specified.
7. 1. Correct the filter for double bonds in the WHERE clause: Replace 'T2.bond_type = ' = '' with 'T2.bond_type = 'double'' (or the correct value that identifies double bonds in your database). 2. Ensure that the query logically retrieves the carcinogenic status: Instead of relying on T1.label directly, you should ensure that it accurately reflects the information regarding carcinogenicity. If 'label' holds the carcinogenic status, consider using 'T1.is_carcinogenic' or a similar relevant column, depending on your database schema. 3. Group the results properly: To allow for counting while also retrieving the carcinogenic status, you'll need to include a GROUP BY clause. For example, add 'GROUP BY T1.is_carcinogenic' to ensure the aggregation works as intended. The modified query should look something like: SELECT COUNT(T2.bond_id) AS double_bond_count, T1.is_carcinogenic FROM molecule AS T1 JOIN bond AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR006' AND T2.bond_type = 'double' GROUP BY T1.is_carcinogenic.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to meet the requirements of the question, follow these actionable steps: 1. Correct the condition for identifying double bonds by replacing the erroneous condition with the correct one. For example, if double bonds are indicated by a specific value such as 'double', the condition should be updated to: T2.bond_type = 'double'. 2. Ensure that the query retrieves the carcinogenicity information accurately. If the carcinogenicity is indicated by a specific field in the 'molecule' table (for example, a boolean or categorical field named 'carcinogenic'), you should update the SELECT clause to include this field directly: T1.carcinogenic AS is_carcinogenic. 3. Update the query as follows: SELECT COUNT(T2.bond_id) AS double_bond_count, T1.carcinogenic AS is_carcinogenic FROM molecule AS T1 JOIN bond AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR006' AND T2.bond_type = 'double'; 4. Finally, verify that the database schema provides the necessary fields for carcinogenicity and that the bond types are correctly specified.

This assumes labels can be 'Yes'/'No'; adjust accordingly based on actual data schema. 

4. The final query could look like this: 'SELECT COUNT(T2.bond_id) AS double_bond_count, MAX(T1.label) AS is_carcinogenic FROM molecule AS T1 JOIN bond AS T2 ON T1.molecule_id = T2.molecule_id WHERE T1.molecule_id = 'TR006' AND T2.bond_type = 'double';'.
