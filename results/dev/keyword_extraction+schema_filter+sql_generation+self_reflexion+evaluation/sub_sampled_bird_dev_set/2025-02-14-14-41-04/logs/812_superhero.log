);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
List down at least five full names of superheroes with blue eyes.

SQL Query:
SELECT DISTINCT T1.full_name FROM superhero AS T1 JOIN colour AS T2 ON T1.eye_colour_id = T2.id WHERE T2.colour = 'Blue' AND T1.eye_colour_id IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;

Database Content:
{'alignment': ['id', 'alignment'], 'attribute': ['id', 'attribute_name'], 'colour': ['id', 'colour'], 'gender': ['id', 'gender'], 'publisher': ['id', 'publisher_name'], 'race': ['id', 'race'], 'superhero': ['id', 'superhero_name', 'full_name', 'gender_id', 'eye_colour_id', 'hair_colour_id', 'skin_colour_id', 'race_id', 'publisher_id', 'alignment_id', 'height_cm', 'weight_kg', 'fullname', 'eyecolourid'], 'hero_attribute': ['hero_id', 'attribute_id', 'attribute_value'], 'superpower': ['id', 'power_name'], 'hero_power': ['hero_id', 'power_id']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Remove the unnecessary condition 'T1.eye_colour_id IS NOT NULL' from the WHERE clause, as it is redundant given the query's intent to filter for blue eyes. 2. Ensure that column naming is corrected; check if 'full_name' is indeed the right column to use or if 'superhero_name' is the correct term in the 'superhero' table. 3. Validate that there are indeed at least five superheroes with blue eyes in the database; if not, consider removing the 'LIMIT 5' constraint or adjusting it to a more appropriate number. 4.

Use `LIMIT 10` for example to expand the search. 4. **Verify JOIN Conditions**: Ensure that the relationship between the `superhero` and `colour` tables is properly set up, and confirm that `eye_colour_id` correctly corresponds to the `id` in the `colour` table. 5. **Use of GROUP BY (optional)**: If there are multiple eye colors per superhero, consider using a `GROUP BY T1.full_name` if you're aggregating or counting, which is not necessary in the current query. 6. **Test Query Execution**: Execute the modified query in your SQL environment and check the results directly to ensure you get at least five names. Adjust further based on the output received."

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Remove the unnecessary condition 'T1.eye_colour_id IS NOT NULL' from the WHERE clause, as it is redundant given the query's intent to filter for blue eyes. 2. Ensure that column naming is corrected; check if 'full_name' is indeed the right column to use or if 'superhero_name' is the correct term in the 'superhero' table. 3. Validate that there are indeed at least five superheroes with blue eyes in the database; if not, consider removing the 'LIMIT 5' constraint or adjusting it to a more appropriate number. 4. Finally, test the modified query to ensure that it returns at least five unique names as expected.
7. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of listing at least five full names of superheroes with blue eyes, consider the following actionable steps: 1. **Check Data Availability**: Ensure that there are at least five superheroes with blue eyes in the database. If the table does not contain enough records, you will not retrieve the expected results. 2. **Remove the DISTINCT Clause (if necessary)**: If duplication of names is not an issue and you want to ensure you get at least five names, removing DISTINCT could help. Alternatively, if there are unique names expected, keep it. 3. **Adjust the LIMIT Value**: Instead of limiting to 5, consider increasing it to a higher number like 10 or 20 to capture more potential names in case of duplicates. Use `LIMIT 10` for example to expand the search. 4. **Verify JOIN Conditions**: Ensure that the relationship between the `superhero` and `colour` tables is properly set up, and confirm that `eye_colour_id` correctly corresponds to the `id` in the `colour` table. 5. **Use of GROUP BY (optional)**: If there are multiple eye colors per superhero, consider using a `GROUP BY T1.full_name` if you're aggregating or counting, which is not necessary in the current query. 6. **Test Query Execution**: Execute the modified query in your SQL environment and check the results directly to ensure you get at least five names. Adjust further based on the output received.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
[{'chain_of_thought': "To answer the question about listing the full names of superheroes with blue eyes, I need to identify superheroes who have an eye_color_id that matches the id of the color 'Blue' in the colour table. This requires a JOIN operation between the superhero table and the colour table based on the eye_colour_id and the id in the colour table. I will also need to ensure to filter out any superheroes where the eye_colour_id is null. Since the question specifies at least five full names, I'll incorporate a LIMIT clause to restrict the results accordingly. Moreover, I'll select only the 'full_name' column from the superhero table as that is the only detail required.", 'SQL': "SELECT DISTINCT T1.full_name FROM superhero AS T1 JOIN colour AS T2 ON T1.eye_colour_id = T2.id WHERE T2.colour = 'Blue' AND T1.eye_colour_id IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;"}, "SELECT DISTINCT T1.full_name FROM superhero AS T1 JOIN colour AS T2 ON T1.eye_colour_id = T2.id WHERE T2.colour = 'Blue' AND T1.eye_colour_id IS NOT NULL LIMIT 5;", "SELECT DISTINCT T1.full_name FROM superhero AS T1 JOIN colour AS T2 ON T1.eye_colour_id = T2.id WHERE T2.colour = 'Blue' LIMIT 5;", "SELECT DISTINCT T1.full_name FROM superhero AS T1 JOIN colour AS T2 ON T1.eye_colour_id = T2.id WHERE T2.colour = 'Blue' LIMIT 5;"]

Question: 
List down at least five full names of superheroes with blue eyes. 

Hint:
blue eyes refers to colour.colour = 'Blue' WHERE eye_colour_id = colour.id;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Input Data

Question:
List down at least five full names of superheroes with blue eyes.

SQL Query:
SELECT DISTINCT T1.full_name FROM superhero AS T1 JOIN colour AS T2 ON T1.eye_colour_id = T2.id WHERE T2.colour = 'Blue' LIMIT 5;

Database Content:
{'alignment': ['id', 'alignment'], 'attribute': ['id', 'attribute_name'], 'colour': ['id', 'colour'], 'gender': ['id', 'gender'], 'publisher': ['id', 'publisher_name'], 'race': ['id', 'race'], 'superhero': ['id', 'superhero_name', 'full_name', 'gender_id', 'eye_colour_id', 'hair_colour_id', 'skin_colour_id', 'race_id', 'publisher_id', 'alignment_id', 'height_cm', 'weight_kg', 'fullname', 'eyecolourid'], 'hero_attribute': ['hero_id', 'attribute_id', 'attribute_value'], 'superpower': ['id', 'power_name'], 'hero_power': ['hero_id', 'power_id']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question is asking for a list of at least five full names of superheroes who have blue eyes. The SQL query attempts to do this by joining the 'superhero' and 'colour' tables based on the eye colour ID to filter superheroes with blue eyes. The use of `DISTINCT` ensures unique full names are retrieved, and the `LIMIT 5` constrains the result to at most five entries. I need to check if the query joins the correct tables and uses the correct attributes. The table 'colour' must contain a 'colour' column with the value 'Blue', and the 'superhero' table must have accurate mappings for 'full_name' and 'eye_colour_id'. Given that the database content structure confirms the right columns are referenced (i.e., the 'superhero' table has 'full_name' and 'eye_colour_id', and the 'colour' table has 'id' and 'colour'), the query logically aligns with the intent of the question. Therefore, it appears the query is designed correctly to fulfill the requirements outlined in the question, and the expected output should match too. Since the database does not explicitly show execution results, assuming the query runs correctly against the schemas, it would be Valid. However, without actual execution results, I cannot definitively confirm the output aligns with the question's intent. Therefore, based on the analysis of the SQL logic versus the given question, the SQL query seems to be correctly structured, addressing all necessary components without omissions or errors.",
