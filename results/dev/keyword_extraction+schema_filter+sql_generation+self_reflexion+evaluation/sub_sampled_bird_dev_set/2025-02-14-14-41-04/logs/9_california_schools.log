This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Input Data

Question:
Among the schools with the average score in Math over 560 in the SAT test, how many schools are directly charter-funded?

SQL Query:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM satscores AS T1 JOIN frpm AS T2 ON T1.cds = T2.CDSCode WHERE T1.AvgScrMath > 560 AND T2.`Charter Funding Type` IS NOT NULL;

Database Content:
{'frpm': ['CDSCode', 'Academic Year', 'County Code', 'District Code', 'School Code', 'County Name', 'District Name', 'School Name', 'District Type', 'School Type', 'Educational Option Type', 'NSLP Provision Status', 'Charter School (Y/N)', 'Charter School Number', 'Charter Funding Type', 'IRC', 'Low Grade', 'High Grade', 'Enrollment (K-12)', 'Free Meal Count (K-12)', 'Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)', 'FRPM Count (K-12)', 'Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (K-12)', 'Enrollment (Ages 5-17)', 'Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)', 'Percent (%) Eligible Free (Ages 5-17)', 'FRPM Count (Ages 5-17)', 'Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (Ages 5-17)', '2013-14 CALPADS Fall 1 Certification Status'], 'satscores': ['cds', 'rtype', 'sname', 'dname', 'cname', 'enroll12', 'NumTstTakr', 'AvgScrRead', 'AvgScrMath', 'AvgScrWrite', 'NumGE1500'], 'schools': ['CDSCode', 'NCESDist', 'NCESSchool', 'StatusType', 'County', 'District', 'School', 'Street', 'StreetAbr', 'City', 'Zip', 'State', 'MailStreet', 'MailStrAbr', 'MailCity', 'MailZip', 'MailState', 'Phone', 'Ext', 'Website', 'OpenDate', 'ClosedDate', 'Charter', 'CharterNum', 'FundingType', 'DOC', 'DOCType', 'SOC', 'SOCType', 'EdOpsCode', 'EdOpsName', 'EILCode', 'EILName', 'GSoffered', 'GSserved', 'Virtual', 'Magnet', 'Latitude', 'Longitude', 'AdmFName1', 'AdmLName1', 'AdmEmail1', 'AdmFName2', 'AdmLName2', 'AdmEmail2', 'AdmFName3', 'AdmLName3', 'AdmEmail3', 'LastUpdate']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query and ensure it aligns with the question's intent, follow these specific steps: 1. Update the condition for filtering charter-funded schools: Instead of checking if 'Charter Funding Type' is not null, explicitly check for charter-funded types. For example, modify the condition to match specific charter funding types in the WHERE clause (e.g., `T2.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Charter'`). 2. Ensure clarity and specificity: Review the `Charter Funding Type` column to understand its possible values so that you can accurately filter for 'directly charter-funded' schools. 3. Keep the current filtering for average Math scores above 560 intact, as that part is correct. 4. Your updated SQL query should look something like this: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM satscores AS T1 JOIN frpm AS T2 ON T1.cds = T2.CDSCode WHERE T1.AvgScrMath > 560 AND T2.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Charter';` These changes will direct the query to count only those schools that meet both criteria defined in the question.
