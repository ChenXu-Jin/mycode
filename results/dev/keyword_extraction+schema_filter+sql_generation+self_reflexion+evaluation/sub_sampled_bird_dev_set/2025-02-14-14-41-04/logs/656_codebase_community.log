This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score. 

Hint:
If the parent id is not null, the post is the child post; the highest score refers to MAX(Score);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the intent of the question, modify it as follows: 1. First, select the child post with the highest score by using a subquery or common table expression (CTE). This will ensure that you are accurately identifying the child post based on its score. 2. Next, in the main query, join the parent post (P2) to the identified child post (P1) to retrieve the parent information. 3. Finally, ensure to select the display name of the user associated with the parent post's OwnerUserId. Here is a modified version of the SQL query: 

```sql
SELECT U.DisplayName 
FROM ( 
    SELECT * 
    FROM posts 
    WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL 
    ORDER BY Score DESC 
    LIMIT 1 
) AS P1 
JOIN posts P2 ON P1.ParentId = P2.Id 
JOIN users U ON P2.OwnerUserId = U.Id;
``` 

This restructuring focuses on finding the child post with the highest score first, ensuring an accurate association with the respective parent display name.

This will require joining the 'posts' table to find the parent post using the ParentId and then joining the 'users' table to get the display name of the user associated with that parent post.

Question: 
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score. 

Hint:
If the parent id is not null, the post is the child post; the highest score refers to MAX(Score);

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Input Data

Question:
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score.

SQL Query:
SELECT U.DisplayName FROM ( SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1 ) AS P1 JOIN posts P2 ON P1.ParentId = P2.Id JOIN users U ON P2.OwnerUserId = U.Id;

Database Content:
{'badges': ['Id', 'UserId', 'Name', 'Date'], 'comments': ['Id', 'PostId', 'Score', 'Text', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postHistory': ['Id', 'PostHistoryTypeId', 'PostId', 'RevisionGUID', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'Text', 'Comment', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postLinks': ['Id', 'CreationDate', 'PostId', 'RelatedPostId', 'LinkTypeId'], 'posts': ['Id', 'PostTypeId', 'AcceptedAnswerId', 'CreaionDate', 'Score', 'ViewCount', 'Body', 'OwnerUserId', 'LasActivityDate', 'Title', 'Tags', 'AnswerCount', 'CommentCount', 'FavoriteCount', 'LastEditorUserId', 'LastEditDate', 'CommunityOwnedDate', 'ParentId', 'ClosedDate', 'OwnerDisplayName', 'LastEditorDisplayName'], 'tags': ['Id', 'TagName', 'Count', 'ExcerptPostId', 'WikiPostId'], 'users': ['Id', 'Reputation', 'CreationDate', 'DisplayName', 'LastAccessDate', 'WebsiteUrl', 'Location', 'AboutMe', 'Views', 'UpVotes', 'DownVotes', 'AccountId', 'Age', 'ProfileImageUrl'], 'votes': ['Id', 'PostId', 'VoteTypeId', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'BountyAmount']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "First, the question asks for the display name of the parent ID for the child post with the highest score. The SQL query's structure indicates that it is attempting to find the child post with the highest score and then join it with the parent post and the user information to retrieve the display name. The selection criterion for the child post is correct, as it retrieves the top-ranked child post based on score. The join operations are appropriate, aiming to link the result back to both parent posts and user data. Upon inspection, the query orders posts by score in descending order and takes the most recent one (the child post) and utilizes the `ParentId` to link back to the corresponding parent post's `OwnerUserId` (via user table) to list the display name. However, it is crucial to confirm the references: the inner query selects from posts that have a non-null `ParentId`, thus ensuring they are indeed child posts. Since everything aligns logically according to expectations set by the question and the database schema, I conclude that the SQL is functioning as intended. The query's execution aligns with the question's requirements, confirming its validity.",
