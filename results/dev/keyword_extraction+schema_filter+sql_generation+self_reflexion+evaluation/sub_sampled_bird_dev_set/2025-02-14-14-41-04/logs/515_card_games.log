This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent of finding the oldest mythic card and its legal play formats, follow these steps: 1. First, use a subquery to identify the UUID of the mythic card with the earliest release date. This allows you to accurately collect the associated information for that specific card. 2. Then, join this result with the 'legalities' table to find the corresponding legal formats. A possible revised query could look like this: 

SELECT T2.format 
FROM legalities T2 
JOIN (SELECT uuid, MIN(originalReleaseDate) AS oldestDate 
      FROM cards 
      WHERE rarity = 'mythic' 
      GROUP BY uuid) T1 
ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid 
WHERE T2.status = 'legal';

This query first finds the oldest mythic card with its UUID and original release date, then retrieves the legal formats associated with that card. Additionally, consider selecting T1.oldestDate to also return the release date alongside the formats.

Input Data

Question:
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats?

SQL Query:
SELECT DISTINCT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format FROM legalities T2 JOIN (SELECT uuid, originalReleaseDate FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' AND originalReleaseDate = (SELECT MIN(originalReleaseDate) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic')) T1 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T2.status = 'legal';

Database Content:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent of finding the oldest mythic card and its legal play formats, follow these steps: 1. First, use a subquery to identify the UUID of the mythic card with the earliest release date. This allows you to accurately collect the associated information for that specific card. 2. Then, join this result with the 'legalities' table to find the corresponding legal formats. A possible revised query could look like this: 

SELECT T2.format 
FROM legalities T2 
JOIN (SELECT uuid, MIN(originalReleaseDate) AS oldestDate 
      FROM cards 
      WHERE rarity = 'mythic' 
      GROUP BY uuid) T1 
ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid 
WHERE T2.status = 'legal';

This query first finds the oldest mythic card with its UUID and original release date, then retrieves the legal formats associated with that card. Additionally, consider selecting T1.oldestDate to also return the release date alongside the formats.
7. ['Modify the subquery to select all mythic cards that share the minimum release date, rather than grouping by UUID. This can be achieved by first calculating the minimum release date separately and then filtering for mythic cards that match this date.', "Incorporate the results of this filtered list of cards into the main query, ensuring it joins with the 'legalities' table appropriately to capture all relevant legal formats associated with these cards.", "Ensure the query returns the original release date alongside all respective formats rather than just filtering for 'legal' status; consider if 'unlimited' or other statuses apply and if those should be included too.", 'Use DISTINCT in the select statement to prevent duplicate rows if multiple formats exist for the same mythic card, enhancing the clarity of results.']
8. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these actionable steps: 
1. Remove the singular condition on the minimum release date from the inner query. Replace the condition with a subquery that retrieves all mythic cards having the minimum release date. Use 'IN' instead of '=' to accommodate multiple cards sharing the same release date. 
   Change: 
   (SELECT MIN(originalReleaseDate) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic') 
   To: 
   (SELECT originalReleaseDate FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' AND originalReleaseDate = (SELECT MIN(originalReleaseDate) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic')) 

2. Modify the inner query to select all uuid and originalReleaseDate pairs for cards that match those release dates, ensuring you capture all mythic cards released on the oldest date. 
3. Ensure the join with the 'legalities' table remains, but rethink the conditions so that it correctly reflects all mythic cards that share the oldest release date along with their legal formats.
4. The revised SQL should look similar to this: 
```sql 
SELECT T1.originalReleaseDate, T2.format 
FROM legalities T2 
JOIN ( 
    SELECT uuid, originalReleaseDate 
    FROM cards 
    WHERE rarity = 'mythic' AND originalReleaseDate IN ( 
        SELECT originalReleaseDate 
        FROM cards 
        WHERE rarity = 'mythic' 
        AND originalReleaseDate = (SELECT MIN(originalReleaseDate) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic') 
    ) 
) T1 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid 
WHERE T2.status = 'legal'; 
``` 
5. After making these changes, test the modified query to ensure it retrieves all mythic cards released on the oldest date and their associated legal formats.

Question: 
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats? 

Hint:
the oldest card refers to MIN(originalReleaseDate); mythic card refers to rarity = 'mythic'; legal play refers to status = 'legal'; play format refers to format
