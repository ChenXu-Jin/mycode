You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the intent of the question, modify the bond type condition to correctly filter for double bonds. Replace the current condition 'B.bond_type = '' = ''' with the correct representation of a double bond in your database, which is likely 'double' or a similar keyword. Here is the revised SQL query:

Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the intent of the question, modify the bond type condition to correctly filter for double bonds. Replace the current condition 'B.bond_type = '' = ''' with the correct representation of a double bond in your database, which is likely 'double' or a similar keyword. Here is the revised SQL query:

SELECT A.atom_id 
FROM atom A 
INNER JOIN connected C ON A.atom_id = C.atom_id 
INNER JOIN bond B ON C.bond_id = B.bond_id 
INNER JOIN molecule M ON A.molecule_id = M.molecule_id 
WHERE M.molecule_id = 'TR012' 
AND A.element = 'c' 
AND B.bond_type = 'double';
7. ['1. Ensure Proper Bond Verification: Modify the query to include a condition that specifically verifies that the carbon atom is involved in the double bond. This can be done by ensuring that both atoms connected by the bond are accounted for, which requires a self-join on the bond table to confirm the connectivity of the double bond.', "2. Add Distinguishing Conditions: Introduce a self-join on the 'connected' table to confirm that both atoms connected by the bond are carbon atoms (if necessary) and one is the one you are seeking, ensuring clarity on the type of bonding.", "3. Clarify Element Filtering: Verify that the element filtering for carbon is done accurately. If carbon has different isotopes or variants, ensure you are filtering with the correct specification (for example, 'C' instead of 'c', if the case is significant).", '4. Confirm the Aggregate Result Set: As part of the final SELECT statement, ensure that you are truly aggregating the results to capture all double bonded carbon atoms by considering potential groupings needed in case of multiple matches.', '5. Include Necessary Distinct Clauses: If needed, add a DISTINCT clause to avoid duplicates if there are multiple connections leading to the same atom ID, so the response is concise.']
