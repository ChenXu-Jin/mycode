This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, modify the filter for creatinine levels to strictly match the medical definition of 'normal.' Replace the condition 'T2.CRE < 1.5' with 'T2.CRE BETWEEN 0.6 AND 1.2' to ensure that only patients with creatinine levels classified as normal are included. The modified SQL query should look like this: 'SELECT MAX(T1.ANA) FROM Examination T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.CRE BETWEEN 0.6 AND 1.2;'. This adjustment will accurately reflect the query's requirement to measure anti-nucleus antibody concentration levels for patients with a normal creatinine level.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, modify the filter for creatinine levels to strictly match the medical definition of 'normal.' Replace the condition 'T2.CRE < 1.5' with 'T2.CRE BETWEEN 0.6 AND 1.2' to ensure that only patients with creatinine levels classified as normal are included. The modified SQL query should look like this: 'SELECT MAX(T1.ANA) FROM Examination T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.CRE BETWEEN 0.6 AND 1.2;'. This adjustment will accurately reflect the query's requirement to measure anti-nucleus antibody concentration levels for patients with a normal creatinine level.
7. To modify the SQL query so that it accurately answers the question regarding the highest anti-nucleus antibody concentration level of patients with a normal creatinine level, you should ensure that the conditions filtering the creatinine levels are applied specifically to the relevant records and that adverse patient records are excluded. Here are the actionable steps:

1. **Check for Proper Join**: Ensure that the JOIN clause between Examination and Laboratory tables is correctly linking the patient records. The ID field must uniquely identify patients across both tables.

2. **Filter on Individually Matched Records**: Instead of just filtering based on a log of creatinine levels, ensure you correlate the ANA values with the patient's specific creatinine level by joining on the appropriate fields (this should already be happening if ID correctly represents a patient across both tables).

3. **Use a Subquery if Necessary**: If the query's structure makes it complex to ensure that only the related ANA levels of patients are being considered, you can implement a subquery to first determine which patients have normal creatinine levels before obtaining their maximum ANA concentration. Example:
   
   ```sql
   SELECT MAX(T1.ANA) FROM Examination T1
   WHERE T1.ID IN (
       SELECT T2.ID FROM Laboratory T2
       WHERE T2.CRE BETWEEN 0.6 AND 1.2
   );
   ```

4. **Confirm Correct Column Names and Data Types**: Double-check that the column names (T1.ANA and T2.CRE) are spelled correctly and correspond consistently to their types—ensure there are no data type mismatches that might affect comparison logic. 

5. **Double-check the Value Range**: If the query also involves edge cases, ensure that the bound values for normal creatinine levels are consistent with medical standards—sometimes referred to ranges can deviate slightly so adjust accordingly if needed. 

These modifications will ensure that the results returned by your SQL query correctly reflect the intent of the original question.

Then, I will use the ORDER BY clause to retrieve the maximum value of ANA.

Question: 
What is the highest anti-nucleus antibody concentration level of a patient with a normal creatinine level? 

Hint:
highest anti-nucleus antibody concentration level refers to MAX(ANA); normal creatinine level refers to CRE < 1.5;
