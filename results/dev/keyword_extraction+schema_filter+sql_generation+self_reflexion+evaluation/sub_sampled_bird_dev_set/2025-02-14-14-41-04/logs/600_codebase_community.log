This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it meets the requirements of the question, follow these steps: 1. **Retrieve ViewCount for Both Related Posts and Post ID 61217**: You need to fetch the ViewCount for the related posts as well as for the post with ID 61217. To do this, you can perform a second query or include a subquery in your current one. 2. **Use a UNION or Subquery**: You can use a UNION to combine the results of the related posts with the ViewCount of the main post. For example: 

   ```sql
   SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.PostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.RelatedPostId = 61217 
   UNION 
   SELECT 61217 AS Id, ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217;
   ```  
   This will ensure you get both the related post(s) and the popularity of the specific post ID. 3. **Ensure Proper Aliasing**: Ensure that any columns in the UNION queries are consistently named so that they can be easily distinguished in the results.  This adjusted SQL will fulfill the requirement of listing all posts related to ID 61217 and provide the popularity of that post.

Input Data

Question:
List out all post that are related to post ID 61217 and what is the popularity of this post?

SQL Query:
SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.PostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.RelatedPostId = 61217 UNION SELECT 61217 AS Id, ViewCount FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217;

Database Content:
{'badges': ['Id', 'UserId', 'Name', 'Date'], 'comments': ['Id', 'PostId', 'Score', 'Text', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postHistory': ['Id', 'PostHistoryTypeId', 'PostId', 'RevisionGUID', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'Text', 'Comment', 'UserDisplayName'], 'postLinks': ['Id', 'CreationDate', 'PostId', 'RelatedPostId', 'LinkTypeId'], 'posts': ['Id', 'PostTypeId', 'AcceptedAnswerId', 'CreaionDate', 'Score', 'ViewCount', 'Body', 'OwnerUserId', 'LasActivityDate', 'Title', 'Tags', 'AnswerCount', 'CommentCount', 'FavoriteCount', 'LastEditorUserId', 'LastEditDate', 'CommunityOwnedDate', 'ParentId', 'ClosedDate', 'OwnerDisplayName', 'LastEditorDisplayName'], 'tags': ['Id', 'TagName', 'Count', 'ExcerptPostId', 'WikiPostId'], 'users': ['Id', 'Reputation', 'CreationDate', 'DisplayName', 'LastAccessDate', 'WebsiteUrl', 'Location', 'AboutMe', 'Views', 'UpVotes', 'DownVotes', 'AccountId', 'Age', 'ProfileImageUrl'], 'votes': ['Id', 'PostId', 'VoteTypeId', 'CreationDate', 'UserId', 'BountyAmount']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for all posts related to post ID 61217 and also requests the popularity, which is indicated by ViewCount, of the specified post. The SQL query attempts to retrieve the related posts by joining the postLinks table (which contains related post information) with the posts table to get the ViewCounts for those posts. The second part of the UNION in the query adds the ViewCount for post ID 61217 itself. However, while the first part of the query is correctly fetching related posts, it does not incorporate an important aspect: it should specifically relate the post ID to the related posts, which is addressed in the query. \n\n    The query structure is logical; it segments the queried posts and the specified post into two parts that will be combined using UNION. Therefore, based on the requirement to list all posts related to post ID 61217 and also include the popularity of that post, the query performs this adequately through appropriate joins and UNION; hence it satisfies the intent of the question. The named columns also match the specifications for output. Upon reviewing the completed SQL execution with the database content provided, it appears the SQL query is indeed aligned with what's asked in the question.",
