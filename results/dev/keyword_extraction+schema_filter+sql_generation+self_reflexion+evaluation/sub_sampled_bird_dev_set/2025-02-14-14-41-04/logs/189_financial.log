This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to correctly answer the question regarding the oldest female clients with the lowest average salary, follow these steps: 1. Calculate the average salary for female clients and determine the minimum average salary using a subquery. 2. Ensure that you are filtering the results based on both the age (oldest client) and the average salary conditions. 3. Use a Group By clause to aggregate the salaries correctly and join it with the main query. Here is a modified version of the SQL query: 

```sql
SELECT A.account_id 
FROM account A 
JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id 
JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id 
JOIN district D2 ON C.district_id = D2.district_id 
WHERE C.gender = 'F' 
AND C.salary = (
    SELECT MIN(avg_sal) 
    FROM ( 
        SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_sal 
        FROM client 
        WHERE gender = 'F' 
        GROUP BY district_id 
    ) AS avg_salaries 
) 
AND C.birth_date = ( 
    SELECT MIN(birth_date) 
    FROM client 
    WHERE gender = 'F' 
) 
ORDER BY C.birth_date ASC; 
``` 4. Ensure you check the appropriate logic for retrieving the oldest female clients with the identified lowest average salary. This new query includes logic to find both the oldest age and the lowest average salary among female clients.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.

Question: 
Name the account numbers of female clients who are oldest and have lowest average salary? 

Hint:
Female refers to 'F' in the gender; A11 contains information about average salary

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to correctly answer the question regarding the oldest female clients with the lowest average salary, follow these steps: 1. Calculate the average salary for female clients and determine the minimum average salary using a subquery. 2. Ensure that you are filtering the results based on both the age (oldest client) and the average salary conditions. 3. Use a Group By clause to aggregate the salaries correctly and join it with the main query. Here is a modified version of the SQL query: 

```sql
SELECT A.account_id 
FROM account A 
JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id 
JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id 
JOIN district D2 ON C.district_id = D2.district_id 
WHERE C.gender = 'F' 
AND C.salary = (
    SELECT MIN(avg_sal) 
    FROM ( 
        SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_sal 
        FROM client 
        WHERE gender = 'F' 
        GROUP BY district_id 
    ) AS avg_salaries 
) 
AND C.birth_date = ( 
    SELECT MIN(birth_date) 
    FROM client 
    WHERE gender = 'F' 
) 
ORDER BY C.birth_date ASC; 
``` 4. Ensure you check the appropriate logic for retrieving the oldest female clients with the identified lowest average salary. This new query includes logic to find both the oldest age and the lowest average salary among female clients.
7. To modify the SQL query to properly answer the question, follow these steps: 1. Add a selection criterion for the oldest female clients by including a condition that filters based on 'birth_date' to find the oldest client. 2. Instead of just using the minimum average salary criteria, combine this with the oldest selection using a proper JOIN or a subquery. 3. Create a subquery that isolates the oldest birth_date from the female clients, then join that result to find those female clients who also meet the lowest average salary condition. The modified query may look something like this: 

SELECT A.account_id 
FROM account A 
JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id 
JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id 
WHERE C.gender = 'F' 
AND C.birth_date = (SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') 
AND D.A11 = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM (SELECT AVG(D3.A11) AS avg_salary FROM district D3 JOIN client C2 ON D3.district_id = C2.district_id WHERE C2.gender = 'F' GROUP BY C2.district_id)) 
ORDER BY C.birth_date ASC;

Here's a high-level modified structure of the SQL query: \n  \n```sql\nWITH OldestFemales AS (\n    SELECT client_id, MIN(birth_date) AS oldest_birth_date\n    FROM client\n    WHERE gender = 'F'\n    GROUP BY client_id\n),\nClientAvgSalaries AS (\n    SELECT client_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary\n    FROM account A JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id\n    JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id\n    WHERE C.gender = 'F'\n    GROUP BY client_id\n)\nSELECT A.account_id\nFROM account A\nJOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id\nJOIN ClientAvgSalaries CAS ON D.client_id = CAS.client_id\nJOIN OldestFemales OF ON CAS.client_id = OF.client_id\nWHERE OF.oldest_birth_date = (SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM OldestFemales)\nAND CAS.avg_salary = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM ClientAvgSalaries)\n;  \n```"

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to correctly answer the question regarding the oldest female clients with the lowest average salary, follow these steps: 1. Calculate the average salary for female clients and determine the minimum average salary using a subquery. 2. Ensure that you are filtering the results based on both the age (oldest client) and the average salary conditions. 3. Use a Group By clause to aggregate the salaries correctly and join it with the main query. Here is a modified version of the SQL query: 

```sql
SELECT A.account_id 
FROM account A 
JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id 
JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id 
JOIN district D2 ON C.district_id = D2.district_id 
WHERE C.gender = 'F' 
AND C.salary = (
    SELECT MIN(avg_sal) 
    FROM ( 
        SELECT AVG(salary) as avg_sal 
        FROM client 
        WHERE gender = 'F' 
        GROUP BY district_id 
    ) AS avg_salaries 
) 
AND C.birth_date = ( 
    SELECT MIN(birth_date) 
    FROM client 
    WHERE gender = 'F' 
) 
ORDER BY C.birth_date ASC; 
``` 4. Ensure you check the appropriate logic for retrieving the oldest female clients with the identified lowest average salary. This new query includes logic to find both the oldest age and the lowest average salary among female clients.
7. To modify the SQL query to properly answer the question, follow these steps: 1. Add a selection criterion for the oldest female clients by including a condition that filters based on 'birth_date' to find the oldest client. 2. Instead of just using the minimum average salary criteria, combine this with the oldest selection using a proper JOIN or a subquery. 3. Create a subquery that isolates the oldest birth_date from the female clients, then join that result to find those female clients who also meet the lowest average salary condition. The modified query may look something like this: 

SELECT A.account_id 
FROM account A 
JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id 
JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id 
WHERE C.gender = 'F' 
AND C.birth_date = (SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') 
AND D.A11 = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM (SELECT AVG(D3.A11) AS avg_salary FROM district D3 JOIN client C2 ON D3.district_id = C2.district_id WHERE C2.gender = 'F' GROUP BY C2.district_id)) 
ORDER BY C.birth_date ASC;
8. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. **Identify Oldest Female Client(s)**: Instead of just finding the minimum birth date, you should first retrieve the oldest female clients. Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) or a subquery to identify the oldest female client's birth date and then filter for clients that match this birth date. 2. **Calculate Average Salary for Each Client**: The SQL query incorrectly attempts to find the lowest average salary across districts. Instead, you need to compute the average salary for each specific female client instead. Use a `GROUP BY` clause on `client_id` or an aggregated subquery to obtain the average salary for these identified clients. 3. **Filter by Lowest Average Salary**: After obtaining the oldest female clients and their respective average salaries, filter to find those with the lowest average salary among them. 4. **Construct Final Query**: Join the required tables, ensuring that when filtering, you join back to the derived table of oldest clients and their average salaries. Integrate the conditions to obtain account numbers correctly. Here's a high-level modified structure of the SQL query: 
  
```sql
WITH OldestFemales AS (
    SELECT client_id, MIN(birth_date) AS oldest_birth_date
    FROM client
    WHERE gender = 'F'
    GROUP BY client_id
),
ClientAvgSalaries AS (
    SELECT client_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM account A JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id
    JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id
    WHERE C.gender = 'F'
    GROUP BY client_id
)
SELECT A.account_id
FROM account A
JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id
JOIN ClientAvgSalaries CAS ON D.client_id = CAS.client_id
JOIN OldestFemales OF ON CAS.client_id = OF.client_id
WHERE OF.oldest_birth_date = (SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM OldestFemales)
AND CAS.avg_salary = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM ClientAvgSalaries)
;  
```
