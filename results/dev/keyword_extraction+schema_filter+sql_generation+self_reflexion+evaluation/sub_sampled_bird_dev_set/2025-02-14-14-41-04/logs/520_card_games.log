This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Who is the illustrator that illustrated the least amount of cards? List the format of play of the cards that he/she illustrated.

SQL Query:
SELECT L.format FROM cards AS C JOIN legalities AS L ON C.uuid = L.uuid WHERE C.artist = (SELECT artist FROM cards GROUP BY artist ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1)

Database Content:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Update the subquery to GROUP BY artist and count cards correctly, and ensure it retrieves the artist along with the count. Use 'ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1' as intended, but include artist selection in the subquery. 2. Handle the case where multiple artists might have illustrated the same least amount of cards. You can achieve this by using a CTE (Common Table Expression) or an inner query to first identify all artists with the least count. 3. Modify the outer query to return both the artist's name and the format of play. You should use a JOIN between the 'cards' table and the 'legalities' table based on illustrator matches with the counts. 4. Ensure to select the relevant columns: the artist's name and L.format from the legalities table where the artist matches. An example of the modified query could look like this: WITH LeastIllustrator AS (SELECT artist FROM cards GROUP BY artist HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT MIN(card_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist) as card_counts)) SELECT C.artist, L.format FROM cards AS C JOIN legalities AS L ON C.uuid = L.uuid WHERE C.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM LeastIllustrator);"

Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Update the subquery to GROUP BY artist and count cards correctly, and ensure it retrieves the artist along with the count. Use 'ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1' as intended, but include artist selection in the subquery. 2. Handle the case where multiple artists might have illustrated the same least amount of cards. You can achieve this by using a CTE (Common Table Expression) or an inner query to first identify all artists with the least count. 3. Modify the outer query to return both the artist's name and the format of play. You should use a JOIN between the 'cards' table and the 'legalities' table based on illustrator matches with the counts. 4. Ensure to select the relevant columns: the artist's name and L.format from the legalities table where the artist matches. An example of the modified query could look like this: WITH LeastIllustrator AS (SELECT artist FROM cards GROUP BY artist HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT MIN(card_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist) as card_counts)) SELECT C.artist, L.format FROM cards AS C JOIN legalities AS L ON C.uuid = L.uuid WHERE C.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM LeastIllustrator);

Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Who is the illustrator that illustrated the least amount of cards? List the format of play of the cards that he/she illustrated.

SQL Query:
WITH LeastIllustrator AS (SELECT artist, COUNT(*) as card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT MIN(card_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist))) SELECT C.artist, L.format FROM cards AS C JOIN legalities AS L ON C.uuid = L.uuid WHERE C.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM LeastIllustrator)

Database Content:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

You are a database technology expert proficient in SQL statements.
Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Who is the illustrator that illustrated the least amount of cards? List the format of play of the cards that he/she illustrated.

SQL Query:
WITH LeastIllustrator AS (SELECT artist FROM cards GROUP BY artist HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT MIN(card_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist))) SELECT DISTINCT C.artist, L.format FROM cards AS C JOIN legalities AS L ON C.uuid = L.uuid WHERE C.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM LeastIllustrator)

Database Content:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Update the subquery to GROUP BY artist and count cards correctly, and ensure it retrieves the artist along with the count. Use 'ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1' as intended, but include artist selection in the subquery. 2. Handle the case where multiple artists might have illustrated the same least amount of cards. You can achieve this by using a CTE (Common Table Expression) or an inner query to first identify all artists with the least count. 3. Modify the outer query to return both the artist's name and the format of play. You should use a JOIN between the 'cards' table and the 'legalities' table based on illustrator matches with the counts. 4. Ensure to select the relevant columns: the artist's name and L.format from the legalities table where the artist matches. An example of the modified query could look like this: WITH LeastIllustrator AS (SELECT artist FROM cards GROUP BY artist HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT MIN(card_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist) as card_counts)) SELECT C.artist, L.format FROM cards AS C JOIN legalities AS L ON C.uuid = L.uuid WHERE C.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM LeastIllustrator);
7. To modify the SQL query to correctly answer the question about the illustrator who illustrated the least amount of cards and to list the formats of play of those cards, follow these steps: 1. Update the CTE 'LeastIllustrator' to also include the UUIDs of the cards illustrated by each artist. Modify the CTE so it selects both artist and card UUID: 'SELECT artist, uuid FROM cards GROUP BY artist, uuid HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT MIN(card_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as card_count FROM cards GROUP BY artist))'. 2. In the final SELECT statement, join the 'cards' table with the 'legalities' table using the UUIDs obtained from the first CTE to ensure that the formats of the cards associated with the least illustrating artist are fetched. The corrected SELECT statement could look like this: 'SELECT DISTINCT C.artist, L.format FROM cards AS C JOIN legalities AS L ON C.uuid = L.uuid WHERE C.artist IN (SELECT artist FROM LeastIllustrator)'. 3. Ensure that you are selecting DISTINCT results if an artist may have illustrated cards in multiple formats. Following these steps will align the query with the question's intent and provide the necessary results.
8. ["Modify the query to ensure that it accounts for illustrators who may not have any cards in the 'legalities' table. Instead of joining the 'cards' table with 'legalities', consider using a LEFT JOIN to include all cards by the illustrator, even those that don’t have corresponding entries in 'legalities'.", 'Revise the main query to handle cases where there are multiple illustrators with the same minimum card count. If there are multiple illustrators, the query should accommodate this without excluding any.', 'Ensure the output includes all distinct formats associated with the illustrator, using a GROUP BY clause to group by the illustrator and include all the formats they illustrated across any card entries.', 'Consider re-evaluating the ordering and selection of results to better reflect the output expected—possibly by returning a full list of formats along with each illustrator, focusing on uniqueness and completeness.']

Question: 
Who is the illustrator that illustrated the least amount of cards? List the format of play of the cards that he/she illustrated. 

Hint:
format of the cards refers to format; illustrator refers to artist; the least amount of cards refers to MIN(artist)

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
