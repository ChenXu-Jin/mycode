This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Please provide the ids of top three powerful pairs of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards sorted by Kingdom Foil id in alphabetical order. 

Hint:
poweful refers to cardKingdomFoilId is not null AND cardKingdomId is not null

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final SQL query.",

If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Please provide the ids of top three powerful pairs of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards sorted by Kingdom Foil id in alphabetical order.

SQL Query:
SELECT id FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId LIMIT 3;

Database Content:
{'cards': ['id', 'artist', 'asciiName', 'availability', 'borderColor', 'cardKingdomFoilId', 'cardKingdomId', 'colorIdentity', 'colorIndicator', 'colors', 'convertedManaCost', 'duelDeck', 'edhrecRank', 'faceConvertedManaCost', 'faceName', 'flavorName', 'flavorText', 'frameEffects', 'frameVersion', 'hand', 'hasAlternativeDeckLimit', 'hasContentWarning', 'hasFoil', 'hasNonFoil', 'isAlternative', 'isFullArt', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isOversized', 'isPromo', 'isReprint', 'isReserved', 'isStarter', 'isStorySpotlight', 'isTextless', 'isTimeshifted', 'keywords', 'layout', 'leadershipSkills', 'life', 'loyalty', 'manaCost', 'mcmId', 'mcmMetaId', 'mtgArenaId', 'mtgjsonV4Id', 'mtgoFoilId', 'mtgoId', 'multiverseId', 'name', 'number', 'originalReleaseDate', 'originalText', 'originalType', 'otherFaceIds', 'power', 'printings', 'promoTypes', 'purchaseUrls', 'rarity', 'scryfallId', 'scryfallIllustrationId', 'scryfallOracleId', 'setCode', 'side', 'subtypes', 'supertypes', 'tcgplayerProductId', 'text', 'toughness', 'type', 'types', 'uuid', 'variations', 'watermark'], 'foreign_data': ['id', 'flavorText', 'language', 'multiverseid', 'name', 'text', 'type', 'uuid'], 'legalities': ['id', 'format', 'status', 'uuid'], 'sets': ['id', 'baseSetSize', 'block', 'booster', 'code', 'isFoilOnly', 'isForeignOnly', 'isNonFoilOnly', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isPartialPreview', 'keyruneCode', 'mcmId', 'mcmIdExtras', 'mcmName', 'mtgoCode', 'name', 'parentCode', 'releaseDate', 'tcgplayerGroupId', 'totalSetSize', 'type'], 'set_translations': ['id', 'language', 'setCode', 'translation'], 'rulings': ['id', 'date', 'text', 'uuid']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Below, you will be presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and the corresponding database content for that query.
Your task is to determine whether the provided SQL query correctly selects the database schema items and accurately answers the given question.
If the SQL query fails to correctly answer the question, please identify the specific errors.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Please provide the ids of top three powerful pairs of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards sorted by Kingdom Foil id in alphabetical order.

SQL Query:
SELECT cardKingdomFoilId, cardKingdomId FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC LIMIT 3;

Database Content:
{'cards': ['id', 'artist', 'asciiName', 'availability', 'borderColor', 'cardKingdomFoilId', 'cardKingdomId', 'colorIdentity', 'colorIndicator', 'colors', 'convertedManaCost', 'duelDeck', 'edhrecRank', 'faceConvertedManaCost', 'faceName', 'flavorName', 'flavorText', 'frameEffects', 'frameVersion', 'hand', 'hasAlternativeDeckLimit', 'hasContentWarning', 'hasFoil', 'hasNonFoil', 'isAlternative', 'isFullArt', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isOversized', 'isPromo', 'isReprint', 'isReserved', 'isStarter', 'isStorySpotlight', 'isTextless', 'isTimeshifted', 'keywords', 'layout', 'leadershipSkills', 'life', 'loyalty', 'manaCost', 'mcmId', 'mcmMetaId', 'mtgArenaId', 'mtgjsonV4Id', 'mtgoFoilId', 'mtgoId', 'multiverseId', 'name', 'number', 'originalReleaseDate', 'originalText', 'originalType', 'otherFaceIds', 'power', 'printings', 'promoTypes', 'purchaseUrls', 'rarity', 'scryfallId', 'scryfallIllustrationId', 'scryfallOracleId', 'setCode', 'side', 'subtypes', 'supertypes', 'tcgplayerProductId', 'text', 'toughness', 'type', 'types', 'uuid', 'variations', 'watermark'], 'foreign_data': ['id', 'flavorText', 'language', 'multiverseid', 'name', 'text', 'type', 'uuid'], 'legalities': ['id', 'format', 'status', 'uuid'], 'sets': ['id', 'baseSetSize', 'block', 'booster', 'code', 'isFoilOnly', 'isForeignOnly', 'isNonFoilOnly', 'isOnlineOnly', 'isPartialPreview', 'keyruneCode', 'mcmId', 'mcmIdExtras', 'mcmName', 'mtgoCode', 'name', 'parentCode', 'releaseDate', 'tcgplayerGroupId', 'totalSetSize', 'type'], 'set_translations': ['id', 'language', 'setCode', 'translation'], 'rulings': ['id', 'date', 'text', 'uuid']}

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. ["1. Clarify the Definition of 'Powerful Pairs': Determine what 'powerful' means in the context of Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards. If there is a specific metric or set of criteria (such as card strength, rarity, or other attributes), ensure these are included in the SQL query.", "2. Include Necessary Joins: If 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards' are in separate tables, ensure to join these tables appropriately within the query to retrieve the pairs. Consider using a JOIN statement to link the two tables based on relevant IDs.", '3. Aggregate Data: If the concept of power is based on aggregate values (such as maximum strength, average power, etc.), include aggregation functions in the query to compute these values for the pairs.', "4. Update the Select Clause: Instead of just selecting 'id', select the relevant IDs from both the Kingdom Foil and Kingdom Cards as part of the output so the pairs are clearly represented.", "5. Correct Sorting Logic: Change the ORDER BY clause to sort by 'cardKingdomFoilId' as required by the question. You may want to consider ordering by the computed power metric first and then by 'cardKingdomFoilId' as a secondary sort if applicable.", '6. Adjust the LIMIT Clause: Ensure that `LIMIT 3` is applied after any sorting is done to retrieve the top three powerful pairs identified based on the criteria established.']
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. **Ensure Aggregation for 'Powerful Pairs'**: Since the question references 'top three powerful pairs', define what makes a pair powerful. If you have a column indicating power (e.g., 'powerLevel'), you would need to aggregate those pairs using something like 'GROUP BY cardKingdomFoilId, cardKingdomId' to select the top pairs based on that metric. 2. **Select Required Fields**: Update the SELECT statement to fetch both cardKingdomFoilId and cardKingdomId, as the question specifically asks for ids of pairs. Use 'SELECT cardKingdomFoilId, cardKingdomId' instead of just 'id'. 3. **Correct Sorting**: Ensure the sorting is done properly by adding 'ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC' to sort in alphabetical order. 4. **Limit the Result**: Finally, include 'LIMIT 3' at the end of the query to restrict the output to the top three results. The modified query should look something like: 'SELECT cardKingdomFoilId, cardKingdomId FROM cards WHERE cardKingdomFoilId IS NOT NULL AND cardKingdomId IS NOT NULL GROUP BY cardKingdomFoilId, cardKingdomId ORDER BY cardKingdomFoilId ASC LIMIT 3'. Adjust the grouping and selection criteria based on the actual definition of 'powerful' as necessary.
8. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. **Define 'Powerful Pairs':** Clarify how 'powerful pairs' are determined. This might involve adding a WHERE clause that specifies any criteria related to strength, power, or ranking for the pairs of 'Kingdom Foil' and 'Kingdom Cards'. For example, if there is a column indicating power level, include a filter to select the top pairs based on that criterion. 2. **Remove LIMIT:** Instead of limiting the results to 3, first retrieve all pairs that meet the 'powerful' criteria, and then apply sorting to ensure correctness before selecting the top three. 3. **Use a Ranking Mechanism:** Consider using a ranking function (e.g., ROW_NUMBER) to rank pairs based on the defined power criteria and then filter to get the top three. 4. **Final Output:** Ensure that the final output includes both 'cardKingdomFoilId' and 'cardKingdomId', maintaining the requirement for both IDs in the result set. 5. **Update ORDER BY Clause:** Confirm that the ordering by 'cardKingdomFoilId' is maintained as specified, ensuring the results are alphabetically sorted. Update the SQL structure accordingly.
