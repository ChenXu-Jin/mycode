Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

This may involve joining to an events or match log table that records player actions. 3. Modify the WHERE clause to not only filter for 'high' attacking work rate but also to correlate with instances of teammates performing attacking moves.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so it aligns with the intent of the question, consider the following actionable steps: 1. Understand that the question is focused on players who have a high attacking work rate specifically when their teammates are also engaging in attack moves. Thus, additional data regarding teammates' actions needs to be incorporated. 2. Identify and incorporate a table or data source that tracks or logs the attacking moves of teammates. This may involve joining to an events or match log table that records player actions. 3. Modify the WHERE clause to not only filter for 'high' attacking work rate but also to correlate with instances of teammates performing attacking moves. An example structure could be: 'SELECT P.player_name FROM Player AS P JOIN Player_Attributes AS T1 ON T1.player_api_id = P.player_api_id JOIN Match_Events AS E ON E.player_api_id = P.player_api_id WHERE T1.attacking_work_rate = 'high' AND E.event_type = 'attack'' 4. Ensure the JOIN conditions and WHERE filters correctly reflect the relationships and context specified in the question regarding teammates' actions.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
[{'chain_of_thought': "To answer the question, we need to identify players who have an 'attacking_work_rate' of 'high'. This column is present in the 'Player_Attributes' table, which relates player attributes to players by their IDs. Therefore, we will need to join the 'Player_Attributes' table with the 'Player' table to get the player names, since the 'Player_Attributes' table contains player IDs but not their names. The final query will select the names of those players with an 'attacking_work_rate' set to 'high'.", 'SQL': "SELECT P.player_name FROM Player_Attributes AS T1 JOIN Player AS P ON T1.player_api_id = P.player_api_id WHERE T1.attacking_work_rate = 'high';"}, "SELECT P.player_name FROM Player_Attributes AS T1 JOIN Player AS P ON T1.player_api_id = P.player_api_id WHERE T1.attacking_work_rate = 'high';"]

Question: 
Who are the players that tend to be attacking when their mates were doing attack moves? List down their name. 

Hint:
tend to be attacking when their mates were doing attack moves refers to attacking_work_rate = 'high';

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so it aligns with the intent of the question, consider the following actionable steps: 1. Understand that the question is focused on players who have a high attacking work rate specifically when their teammates are also engaging in attack moves. Thus, additional data regarding teammates' actions needs to be incorporated. 2. Identify and incorporate a table or data source that tracks or logs the attacking moves of teammates. This may involve joining to an events or match log table that records player actions. 3. Modify the WHERE clause to not only filter for 'high' attacking work rate but also to correlate with instances of teammates performing attacking moves. An example structure could be: 'SELECT P.player_name FROM Player AS P JOIN Player_Attributes AS T1 ON T1.player_api_id = P.player_api_id JOIN Match_Events AS E ON E.player_api_id = P.player_api_id WHERE T1.attacking_work_rate = 'high' AND E.event_type = 'attack'' 4. Ensure the JOIN conditions and WHERE filters correctly reflect the relationships and context specified in the question regarding teammates' actions.
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, consider the following steps: 1. Incorporate a table that tracks match events or player actions, as you need to relate player performances to specific instances when their teammates are executing attacking moves. 2. Use an additional JOIN to connect the Player_Attributes table and the match or events table, ensuring you can filter results based on when teammates are performing attack moves. 3. Add a condition to your WHERE clause that specifies teammates' actions, ensuring that you only select players who have a high attacking work rate during those crucial events. 4. Adjust the SELECT clause as needed to retrieve the relevant player names based on these criteria. Example modified query structure: SELECT P.player_name FROM Player_Attributes AS T1 JOIN Player AS P ON T1.player_api_id = P.player_api_id JOIN Match_Events AS ME ON T1.player_api_id = ME.player_api_id WHERE T1.attacking_work_rate = 'high' AND ME.event_type = 'attack' AND ME.teammate_action = 'attack';  This will ensure you're accurately capturing the scenario where players are more likely to be attacking when their teammates are also engaged in attacking moves.
