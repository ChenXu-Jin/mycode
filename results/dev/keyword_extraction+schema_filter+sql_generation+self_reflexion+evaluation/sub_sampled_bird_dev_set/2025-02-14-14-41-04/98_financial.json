First, I need to identify entries from the 'loan' table where the date falls within 1997. Then, out of those entries, I will order by the amount of the loan to determine the lowest approved amount. To ensure I am considering weekly issuance, I'll need to join the 'account' table to get the relevant frequency. To meet the requirements of the schema and instructions, I will use alias names when joining these tables and filter out accounts that do not have 'POPLATEK TYDNE' as their frequency. Finally, I'll select only the account id of the account with the lowest approved amount. The structure will order by amount ascending and limit to 1 to get the lowest amount.",
