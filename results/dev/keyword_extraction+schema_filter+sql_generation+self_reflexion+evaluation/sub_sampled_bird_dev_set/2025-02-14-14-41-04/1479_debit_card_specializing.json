First, I'll have to find the CustomerIDs in the 'customers' table where the Currency is 'CZK'. Then, I will join this filtered list of CustomerIDs with the 'yearmonth' table to sum up the Consumption values by year. The year can be extracted from the first four characters of the Date column in the 'yearmonth' table. Finally, I will order the results by the total consumption in descending order and limit the query to return only the top result to find the year with the most consumption. The final SQL will include the year extracted from the Date column and the total consumption, and I will not include any extra columns.",
