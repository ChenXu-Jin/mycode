First, I'll filter the 'atom' table to find the Sulphur atoms by checking if the 'element' is 's'. Then, in the 'bond' table, I'll filter the bonds to find those with 'bond_type' as ' = '. After identifying the relevant Sulphur atoms and double bonds, I will use the 'connected' table to establish which molecules these atoms and bonds are part of. The resulting molecule_ids from this connection will give me the desired result, which I can extract from the 'molecule' table for the final output.",
