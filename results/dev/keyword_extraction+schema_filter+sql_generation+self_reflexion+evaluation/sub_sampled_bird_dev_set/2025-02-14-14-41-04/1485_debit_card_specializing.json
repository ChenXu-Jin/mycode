The date format for April 2013 is 201304. We can select the consumption values for both customers filtering them by CustomerID and the specified date. Then, we will compute the difference between customer 7's consumption and customer 5's consumption. Since the question implies we need to calculate a difference, I\u2019ll compute this directly in the query. This will allow us to output the consumption difference directly.
