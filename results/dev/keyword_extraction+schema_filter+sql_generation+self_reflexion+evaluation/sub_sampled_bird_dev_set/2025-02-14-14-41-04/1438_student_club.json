We can start by focusing on the member table, searching for the first name 'Katy' and matching it with the provided link to major 'rec1N0upiVLy5esTO'. Once we find the relevant member, we can retrieve their link_to_major, which will allow us to join the major table to obtain the corresponding college. Therefore, the necessary SQL query needs to select the college from the major table after performing a join based on the member's link_to_major and the specific major ID.",
