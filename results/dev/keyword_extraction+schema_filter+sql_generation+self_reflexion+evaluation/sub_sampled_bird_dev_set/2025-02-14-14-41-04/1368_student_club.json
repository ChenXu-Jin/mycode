First, I'll join the member table with the major table based on the foreign key relationship. I will select the 'major_name' from the major table as it is relevant to what the question asks. Following the guidance, I will apply an INNER JOIN between the member and major tables and filter the results using the specified phone number. I'll ensure that I only select the 'major_name' column as that is all that is requested in the question.",
