Next, the question specifies that the superhero should be of the race 'human', which is represented in the 'race' table and referenced in the 'superhero' table via 'race_id'. I need to join the 'superhero', 'race', and 'colour' tables. I will use aliases for clarity in my joins. Finally, I only need to select the hair color which corresponds to the 'hair_colour_id' in the 'superhero' table that links to the 'colour' table. Therefore, the final SQL query will join these tables and filter based on height and race, selecting only the relevant hair color.",
