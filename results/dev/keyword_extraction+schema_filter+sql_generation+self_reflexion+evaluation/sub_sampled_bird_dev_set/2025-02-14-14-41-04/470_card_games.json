The relationship between cards and sets is not direct in the schema, but the card itself can be identified through its name. The `sets` table has a `releaseDate` column that I need to query. Since the card name 'Ancestor's Chosen' matches the example of 'name' in the cards table, I will filter the `sets` table using the appropriate join to get the release date. Finally, I will format the SQL query to select the `releaseDate` from the `sets` table by filtering using the relevant card name from the `cards` table.",
