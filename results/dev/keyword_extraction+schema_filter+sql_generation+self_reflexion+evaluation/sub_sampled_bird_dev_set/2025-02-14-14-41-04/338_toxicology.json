Since we are interested in atoms and their bonds with specific characteristics, I will be working with the 'atom', 'bond', and 'connected' tables, as well as the 'molecule' table for filtering the molecule by ID. The 'atom' table will help me get the atom ID, the 'bond' table will help me identify the bond type, and the 'connected' table will allow me to link atoms to their bonds. I will look for carbon atoms, which are represented by the element 'c', and also find double bonds represented by the bond type ' = '. \n\nTo retrieve the relevant data, I will start by joining the 'molecule' table to filter for TR012, and then join the 'atom' and 'bond' tables through the 'connected' table to access the bond type. I will ensure that I filter for atoms that correspond to the carbon element and for double bonds. This will give me the atom ID of the double-bonded carbon in the TR012 molecule. Throughout the query, I will ensure to use aliases for clarity and to follow the instructions to output only the necessary columns.",
