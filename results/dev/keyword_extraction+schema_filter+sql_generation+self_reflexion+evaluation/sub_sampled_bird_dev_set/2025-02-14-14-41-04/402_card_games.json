The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of Story Spotlight cards that are textless by the total count of Story Spotlight cards, then multiplying by 100. I will use a subquery to count the total number of Story Spotlight cards, and then filter for those that are textless. Also, since the question asks for IDs of these cards, I will select the ID of the cards that meet the criteria as well.
