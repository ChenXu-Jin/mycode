This means these cards are regarded as 'powerful.' Next, I need to collect the ids of these cards and sort them by 'cardKingdomFoilId' in alphabetical order. Finally, since I only want the top three results, I will limit the output to three records. The resulting SQL query will achieve these goals by selecting the 'id' column from the filtered results, applying the required ordering and limiting.
