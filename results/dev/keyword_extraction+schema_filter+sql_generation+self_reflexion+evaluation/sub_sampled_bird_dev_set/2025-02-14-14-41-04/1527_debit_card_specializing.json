The revenue for each transaction can be calculated by multiplying the 'Amount' and 'Price' columns. I will then group the results by 'GasStationID' and sum the revenue. To find the gas station with the highest revenue, I will order the results in descending order by the total revenue and limit the results to the top one entry. The relevant tables are 'transactions_1k' and 'gasstations', and I will join these tables on the 'GasStationID' to obtain the gas station's details.
