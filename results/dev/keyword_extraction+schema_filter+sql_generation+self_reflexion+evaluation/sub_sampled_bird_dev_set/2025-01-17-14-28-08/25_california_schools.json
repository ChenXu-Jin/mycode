The question specifically asks for schools located in Riverside and for schools where the average of average math scores from the 'satscores' table is greater than 400. To achieve this, I'll need to use a JOIN operation to combine data from both tables using their foreign key relationship. First, I will filter the schools to only include those in Riverside. Next, I'll compute the average of the average math scores from the 'satscores' table, grouping by the school. Finally, I will filter out the groups where the average math score is higher than 400 and select the names of the schools along with their funding types. Using aggregate functions, I will also ensure to skip null values while calculating averages to maintain data integrity.",
