I will focus on the columns necessary for the average calculation (height_cm) and ensure that I only consider entries from 'Marvel Comics'. To calculate the average height, I will use the AVG function on the height_cm column. The publisher table helps me filter the superheroes that belong to 'Marvel Comics' by matching the publisher's name.
