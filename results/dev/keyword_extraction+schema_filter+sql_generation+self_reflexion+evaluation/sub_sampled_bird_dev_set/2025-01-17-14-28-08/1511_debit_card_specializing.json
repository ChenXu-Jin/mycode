I will join this table with the 'transactions_1k' table using 'CustomerID' to get the transaction data for those customers. After that, I will calculate the total price for each customer by summing their transaction prices, and then I will compute the average of these sums. Since I need to return the average total price, I will use the AVG function on the summed prices while grouping by customer ID to ensure the calculation is correctly aggregated. Finally, I will exclude any null values in the Price column to ensure accurate calculations. The query is structured to meet all the specifications provided in the instructions.",
