Since we are interested only in the Fresno Unified district, I'll filter for this district in the 'satscores' table. I will sort these results based on 'AvgScrRead' to get the lowest average reading score. Using 'ORDER BY AvgScrRead ASC LIMIT 1' will help retrieve the school with the lowest average score. Next, I will join the result with the 'schools' table to get the telephone number of that school, as the telephone number is found in the 'schools' table. The final output should only contain the telephone number without extra details.",
