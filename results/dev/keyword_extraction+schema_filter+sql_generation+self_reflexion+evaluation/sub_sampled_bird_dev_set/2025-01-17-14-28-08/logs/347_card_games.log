This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniele' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;

Execution Result:
None

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniele' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;

Execution Result:
None

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. ["1. Correct the artist's name in the WHERE clause. Change 'Stephen Daniele' to 'Stephen Daniel' to ensure accurate filtering of records.", '2. Include a check for missing or degraded properties and values as specified in the question. You may need to add conditions in the WHERE clause that check for NULL or specific statuses in relevant columns that indicate missing or degraded properties.', "3. Ensure that the query selects additional columns that demonstrate the missing or degraded status. This might involve modifying the SELECT statement to include the relevant property columns from the 'cards' table that indicate the status of the card properties.", "4.

The goal is to find all cards illustrated by 'Stephen Daniel' and describe their rulings, while also noting if these cards have any missing or degraded properties indicated by the condition `hasContentWarning = 1`. My analysis begins by recognizing that the relevant data is stored in two tables: 'cards' and 'rulings'. The 'cards' table contains information about the illustrations, including the artist's name, while the 'rulings' table holds the ruling text linked by the uuid of the cards. \n\nSo, I will join these two tables based on the `uuid` column which serves as the foreign key. The filter for the artist's name should use the corrected name 'Stephen Daniel' instead of 'Stephen Daniele' as specified in the guiding principles to ensure accurate filtering. Additionally, I'll include a condition to filter the cards that have missing or degraded properties, which is determined by checking for `hasContentWarning = 1`. \n\nI'll only select necessary columns, namely the id from the 'cards' table and the ruling text from the 'rulings' table. Since the prompt does not explicitly ask for additional columns, I will limit the selection to those required elements. I will also apply aliases to the tables for better clarity and conciseness in the query. Finally, I will ensure that I handle the text from the rulings correctly, including cards with no rulings by using a LEFT JOIN instead of the typical JOIN, but given the focus of the question, swinging back to the implied requirement of cards that do have rulings seems reasonable.\n\nBased on this analysis, I generate the final SQL query.",

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 LEFT JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;

Execution Result:
None

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT T1.id, T2.text FROM cards T1 LEFT JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel' AND T1.hasContentWarning = 1;

Execution Result:
None

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': "The question asks for all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel, along with their ruling texts, and should also indicate if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values. The SQL query selects the card IDs and ruling texts where the artist is Stephen Daniel and includes a condition that the cards must have a content warning (hasContentWarning = 1).

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. ["1. Correct the artist's name in the WHERE clause. Change 'Stephen Daniele' to 'Stephen Daniel' to ensure accurate filtering of records.", '2. Include a check for missing or degraded properties and values as specified in the question. You may need to add conditions in the WHERE clause that check for NULL or specific statuses in relevant columns that indicate missing or degraded properties.', "3. Ensure that the query selects additional columns that demonstrate the missing or degraded status. This might involve modifying the SELECT statement to include the relevant property columns from the 'cards' table that indicate the status of the card properties.", "4. If applicable, consider adding a LEFT JOIN between the 'cards' and 'rulings' tables to ensure that all cards by Stephen Daniel are included, even if they have no corresponding ruling. Then handle the absence of ruling text appropriately (e.g., by providing a default value or indicating that text is missing)."]
7. ["1. Remove the condition 'T1.hasContentWarning = 1' from the WHERE clause. Since the results returned 'None', it may indicate that there are no cards by Stephen Daniel with a content warning. Instead, you should query all cards by the artist regardless of the content warning status.", "2. Include additional conditions or columns to check for missing or degraded properties and values. These might be represented in the 'cards' table, so ensure to select the relevant fields that indicate properties or values related to degradation.", "3. Modify the SELECT statement to include properties and values of the cards. For example, add fields like 'T1.missingProperty' and 'T1.degradedValue' if these exist in the cards table, which could help in identifying the conditions mentioned in the question.", '4. Consider using a more appropriate join method depending on the data integrity between the cards and rulings tables. For example, a RIGHT JOIN or INNER JOIN may provide results only if both tables have matching entries.', '5. Ensure that any necessary data fields that specify the properties or states of degradation or absence are correctly referenced in your SQL query.']
8. ["1. Remove the condition 'WHERE T1.hasContentWarning = 1' as this may be too restrictive and prevents matching cards. The question does not state that you should only find cards with a content warning.", "2. To address the requirement for indicating if the cards have missing or degraded properties and values, you should include additional information in your SELECT statement. This could involve including columns that denote the status of properties and values. For example, if there are columns like 'hasMissingProperties' or 'isDegraded', include them in the SELECT clause.", "3. Adjust the query to ensure it's comprehensive. A suggested modified query could look like this: 'SELECT T1.id, T2.text, T1.hasMissingProperties, T1.isDegraded FROM cards T1 LEFT JOIN rulings T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.artist = 'Stephen Daniel';'. This will give you the ruling text along with any indicators that reflect property issues.", '4. After applying these changes, re-run the query to check if it returns the expected result set.']

Question: 
Find all cards illustrated by Stephen Daniel and describe the text of the ruling of these cards. State if these cards have missing or degraded properties and values. 

Hint:
cards have missing or degraded properties and value refers to hasContentWarning = 1; 'Stephen Daniele' is artist;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
