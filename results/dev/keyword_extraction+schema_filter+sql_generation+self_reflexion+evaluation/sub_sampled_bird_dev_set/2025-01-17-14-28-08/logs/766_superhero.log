This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

It might be useful to run separate JOIN queries to see if the individual JOIN operations yield results. 3. Additional Filtering: If there are NULL values in the 'attribute_value' column, consider adding a condition to filter out NULLs in your original query; for example, you could add 'AND T2.attribute_value IS NOT NULL' to the WHERE clause. 4. Review Data Types: Ensure that the attribute_value being compared is of the correct data type for sorting. Confirm that there is no data type mismatch that could be causing the issue. 5.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify the Existence of Data: First, check if there are actually any records in the 'hero_attribute' table associated with 'strength'. You can execute a simpler query like 'SELECT * FROM hero_attribute WHERE attribute_id IN (SELECT id FROM attribute WHERE attribute_name = 'strength')' to ensure that data exists. 2.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify the Existence of Data: First, check if there are actually any records in the 'hero_attribute' table associated with 'strength'. You can execute a simpler query like 'SELECT * FROM hero_attribute WHERE attribute_id IN (SELECT id FROM attribute WHERE attribute_name = 'strength')' to ensure that data exists. 2. Confirm Joins: Ensure that the foreign keys between the tables are correctly defined and that there are matching entries across the 'superhero', 'hero_attribute', and 'attribute' tables. It might be useful to run separate JOIN queries to see if the individual JOIN operations yield results. 3. Additional Filtering: If there are NULL values in the 'attribute_value' column, consider adding a condition to filter out NULLs in your original query; for example, you could add 'AND T2.attribute_value IS NOT NULL' to the WHERE clause. 4. Review Data Types: Ensure that the attribute_value being compared is of the correct data type for sorting. Confirm that there is no data type mismatch that could be causing the issue. 5. Refine Your Query: Once data presence is confirmed and integrity checks are done, consider modifying the SQL query to something like this for clarity: 'SELECT T1.full_name FROM superhero T1 JOIN hero_attribute T2 ON T1.id = T2.hero_id JOIN attribute T3 ON T2.attribute_id = T3.id WHERE T3.attribute_name = 'strength' AND T2.attribute_value IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T2.attribute_value DESC LIMIT 1'. This ensures you are explicitly checking for non-null values while fetching the highest attribute value.
7. 1. Confirm Data Availability: First, check if there are entries in the 'hero_attribute' and 'attribute' tables, particularly for the 'strength' attribute. Ensure that these tables contain relevant data before running the query. If they are empty or missing expected entries, you will not yield results. 

2. Adjust for Missing Data: If the data for 'strength' does not exist, consider extending the query to return a default response or a message indicating that no hero has a recorded strength attribute. This can be done by using a LEFT JOIN or by checking the count of results returned. 

3. Ensure Correct Joins: Make sure that the join conditions are correct. Ensure that there are no issues with the 'hero_id' or 'attribute_id' references which might lead to missing links in the resulting dataset. 

4. Review Attribute Naming: Verify that the attribute name 'strength' exactly matches how it is stored in the 'attribute' table, as any discrepancies in casing or spelling will lead to no matches. Consider using a wildcard in a WHERE clause (e.g., WHERE T3.attribute_name LIKE '%strength%') if there may be variations. 

5. Output Verification: Adjust the query to check if ordering by 'attribute_value' is causing any issues or if additional filtering might be applied unnecessarily. 

6. Test Iteratively: Run iterations of the query by progressively relaxing conditions (like filtering out 'IS NOT NULL') to identify where results may be becoming empty, and ensure the query is functioning as intended for existing data.

Short-Term Memory:

Question: 
What is the hero's full name with the highest attribute in strength? 

Hint:
highest attribute in strength refers to MAX(attribute_value) WHERE attribute_name = 'strength';

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify the Existence of Data: First, check if there are actually any records in the 'hero_attribute' table associated with 'strength'. You can execute a simpler query like 'SELECT * FROM hero_attribute WHERE attribute_id IN (SELECT id FROM attribute WHERE attribute_name = 'strength')' to ensure that data exists. 2. Confirm Joins: Ensure that the foreign keys between the tables are correctly defined and that there are matching entries across the 'superhero', 'hero_attribute', and 'attribute' tables. It might be useful to run separate JOIN queries to see if the individual JOIN operations yield results. 3. Additional Filtering: If there are NULL values in the 'attribute_value' column, consider adding a condition to filter out NULLs in your original query; for example, you could add 'AND T2.attribute_value IS NOT NULL' to the WHERE clause. 4. Review Data Types: Ensure that the attribute_value being compared is of the correct data type for sorting. Confirm that there is no data type mismatch that could be causing the issue. 5.

This ensures you are explicitly checking for non-null values while fetching the highest attribute value.
7. 1. Confirm Data Availability: First, check if there are entries in the 'hero_attribute' and 'attribute' tables, particularly for the 'strength' attribute. Ensure that these tables contain relevant data before running the query. If they are empty or missing expected entries, you will not yield results. 

2. Adjust for Missing Data: If the data for 'strength' does not exist, consider extending the query to return a default response or a message indicating that no hero has a recorded strength attribute. This can be done by using a LEFT JOIN or by checking the count of results returned. 

3. Ensure Correct Joins: Make sure that the join conditions are correct. Ensure that there are no issues with the 'hero_id' or 'attribute_id' references which might lead to missing links in the resulting dataset. 

4. Review Attribute Naming: Verify that the attribute name 'strength' exactly matches how it is stored in the 'attribute' table, as any discrepancies in casing or spelling will lead to no matches. Consider using a wildcard in a WHERE clause (e.g., WHERE T3.attribute_name LIKE '%strength%') if there may be variations. 

5. Output Verification: Adjust the query to check if ordering by 'attribute_value' is causing any issues or if additional filtering might be applied unnecessarily. 

6. Test Iteratively: Run iterations of the query by progressively relaxing conditions (like filtering out 'IS NOT NULL') to identify where results may be becoming empty, and ensure the query is functioning as intended for existing data.
8. 1. Confirm that there are entries in the 'hero_attribute' table for strength and that the 'attribute_value' is not null. If there are no such entries, the query will always return 'None'. If the table is empty or lacks valid entries, add data to it that satisfies these conditions.

2. Make sure that there is a valid mapping in the 'attribute' table for an attribute named 'strength'. Check if the attribute name is spelled correctly and exists in the database. If it’s misspelled or missing, correct it or add it.

3. If there are potential records with null or insignificant strength values, adjust the logic to account for this. Consider whether you want to include heroes with a strength of zero or a minimal value as potential candidates, or explicitly manage instances where attribute values may not be populated.

4. Verify that the 'full_name' field in the 'superhero' table is being populated correctly, and assure compliance with the database entries for specific heroes. Confirm that there's at least one hero that has a defined unique 'full_name'.

5. Finally, run the query parts individually (each JOIN and WHERE clause) to confirm the output at each step and diagnose where the breakdown occurs that leads to no records being returned.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "First, the goal is to find the full name of the superhero who has the highest attribute value for strength. To do this, I need to join the 'superhero', 'hero_attribute', and 'attribute' tables because the strength attribute is located in the 'hero_attribute' table while the superhero's full name is in the 'superhero' table. The attribute name 'strength' must be confirmed by joining with the 'attribute' table. Additionally, I'll ensure to filter out any NULL values for the 'attribute_value'. Following the guiding principles, I will use ORDER BY in combination with LIMIT to retrieve the superhero with the highest strength attribute. Since I only need the full name and not any other details, I will specifically select the 'full_name' of the superhero. I will construct the SQL query maintaining clear joins and conditions, ensuring to filter out nulls in 'attribute_value'. Lastly, I will adhere to avoiding the use of aggregates like MAX and instead rely on ORDER BY + LIMIT to extract the result directly.",
    "SQL": "SELECT T1.full_name FROM superhero T1 JOIN hero_attribute T2 ON T1.id = T2.hero_id JOIN attribute T3 ON T2.attribute_id = T3.id WHERE T3.attribute_name = 'strength' AND T2.attribute_value IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T2.attribute_value DESC LIMIT 1"
