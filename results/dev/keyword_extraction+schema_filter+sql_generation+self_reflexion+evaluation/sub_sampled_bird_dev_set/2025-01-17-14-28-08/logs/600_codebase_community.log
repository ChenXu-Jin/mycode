This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
List out all post that are related to post ID 61217 and what is the popularity of this post?

SQL Query:
SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217

Execution Result:
(33392, 1494)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

############################## AI at step evaluator_generate_result ##############################

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks to list all posts related to post ID 61217 and inquire about the popularity of this post. The SQL query provided performs a join between 'postLinks' and 'posts' tables where it filters on 'PostId' 61217 to get the 'Id' and 'ViewCount' of related posts. The execution result returns a single post ID (33392) along with its view count (1494). This suggests that there is one post related to the specified post ID and provides its popularity in terms of view count. The query fulfills the condition of listing all related posts (though only one was found) and retrieves the relevant view count, thereby addressing the components outlined in the question. However, the question also asks about the popularity of post ID 61217 itself, which is not explicitly included in the SQL query or result. Thus, while the SQL statement captures what is requested, it does so incompletely since it does not provide the popularity metric of the original post (ID 61217) as asked in the question.

Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
List out all post that are related to post ID 61217 and what is the popularity of this post?

Predicted SQL:
SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217

Execution Result:
(33392, 1494)

Evaluation Result:

Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."

{
    "feedback": "To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to ensure that both the popularity of the specified post (ID 61217) and all posts related to it are included in the result set. Here are the actionable steps to modify the SQL query:\n\n1. **Retrieve Popularity of the Original Post**: You need to include the view count for post ID 61217 in your results. This can be done by adding a SELECT clause that includes its view count.\n\n2. **Use a UNION to Combine Results**: To fetch the popularity of post ID 61217 and related posts in a single result set, consider using a UNION. This will allow you to append the popularity of post ID 61217 to the results of related posts.\n\n3. **Combine Queries into One**: Write one part of the query to get the related posts and their view counts, and another part to fetch the view count of post ID 61217 itself.\n\nHere is an example of how the modified SQL could look:\n```sql\nSELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount \nFROM postLinks AS T1 \nJOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id \nWHERE T1.PostId = 61217 \nUNION ALL \nSELECT 61217 AS Id, ViewCount \nFROM posts \nWHERE Id = 61217;\n```\n4. **Check Query Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly fetches the view count from both the related posts and the specified post.\n\nBy following these steps, the modified SQL query will comprehensively reflect the requirements set out in the original question."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to ensure that both the popularity of the specified post (ID 61217) and all posts related to it are included in the result set. Here are the actionable steps to modify the SQL query:

1. **Retrieve Popularity of the Original Post**: You need to include the view count for post ID 61217 in your results. This can be done by adding a SELECT clause that includes its view count.

2. **Use a UNION to Combine Results**: To fetch the popularity of post ID 61217 and related posts in a single result set, consider using a UNION. This will allow you to append the popularity of post ID 61217 to the results of related posts.

3. **Combine Queries into One**: Write one part of the query to get the related posts and their view counts, and another part to fetch the view count of post ID 61217 itself.

Here is an example of how the modified SQL could look:
```sql
SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount 
FROM postLinks AS T1 
JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id 
WHERE T1.PostId = 61217 
UNION ALL 
SELECT 61217 AS Id, ViewCount 
FROM posts 
WHERE Id = 61217;
```
4. **Check Query Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly fetches the view count from both the related posts and the specified post.

By following these steps, the modified SQL query will comprehensively reflect the requirements set out in the original question.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to ensure that both the popularity of the specified post (ID 61217) and all posts related to it are included in the result set. Here are the actionable steps to modify the SQL query:

List out all post that are related to post ID 61217 and what is the popularity of this post?

Predicted SQL:
SELECT T2.Id AS RelatedPostId, T2.ViewCount AS Popularity FROM postLinks AS T1 JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id WHERE T1.PostId = 61217 UNION ALL SELECT 61217 AS RelatedPostId, ViewCount AS Popularity FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217;

Execution Result:
(33392, 1494)

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': "The question asks for all posts related to post ID 61217 and the popularity of each of those posts. The SQL query aims to achieve this by selecting related posts and aggregating their view counts. It utilizes a JOIN to link 'postLinks' with 'posts' to find the related posts based on the specified post ID. Additionally, the SQL query includes a UNION ALL clause to also retrieve the view count for the original post (ID 61217) itself. The execution result shows one related post (33392) and its view count (1494), which is a valid associated post but does not explicitly mention the view count for post ID 61217 because it does not appear in the results. The expected output should include both related posts and the popularity count for post ID 61217 in the final result, therefore it does not completely fulfill the requirements of the question as explicitly asked.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:

    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query to meet the requirements of the question, follow these steps: \n1. Ensure that the result includes the view count for post ID 61217 as part of the result set. This can be achieved by using a subquery or by applying a JOIN that explicitly includes the original post alongside the related posts.\n2. Instead of using UNION ALL, use a single SELECT statement that selects the related posts as well as the specified post (ID 61217) together. \n3. Modify the final query to include '61217' in the same query context as the related posts, ensuring that the view count of the original post is correctly displayed in the result. The corrected SQL query might look something like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT T2.Id AS RelatedPostId, T2.ViewCount AS Popularity \nFROM postLinks AS T1 \nJOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id \nWHERE T1.PostId = 61217 \nUNION ALL \nSELECT 61217 AS RelatedPostId, ViewCount AS Popularity \nFROM posts \nWHERE Id = 61217;\n``` \n4. Alternatively, consider using a JOIN to fetch both related posts and the main post in a single result: \n```sql\nSELECT T2.Id AS RelatedPostId, T2.ViewCount AS Popularity \nFROM postLinks AS T1 \nJOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id \nWHERE T1.PostId = 61217 \nUNION ALL \nSELECT 61217 AS RelatedPostId, ViewCount AS Popularity \nFROM posts WHERE Id = 61217;\n```\n5. Ensure both sets of results are handled appropriately so that you do not inadvertently omit any necessary output. The final results should reflect both the related posts and the specified post's popularity in a clear and aligned way."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to ensure that both the popularity of the specified post (ID 61217) and all posts related to it are included in the result set. Here are the actionable steps to modify the SQL query:

1. **Retrieve Popularity of the Original Post**: You need to include the view count for post ID 61217 in your results. This can be done by adding a SELECT clause that includes its view count.

2. **Use a UNION to Combine Results**: To fetch the popularity of post ID 61217 and related posts in a single result set, consider using a UNION. This will allow you to append the popularity of post ID 61217 to the results of related posts.

3. **Combine Queries into One**: Write one part of the query to get the related posts and their view counts, and another part to fetch the view count of post ID 61217 itself.

Here is an example of how the modified SQL could look:
```sql
SELECT T2.Id, T2.ViewCount 
FROM postLinks AS T1 
JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id 
WHERE T1.PostId = 61217 
UNION ALL 
SELECT 61217 AS Id, ViewCount 
FROM posts 
WHERE Id = 61217;
```
4. **Check Query Logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly fetches the view count from both the related posts and the specified post.

By following these steps, the modified SQL query will comprehensively reflect the requirements set out in the original question.
7. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Modify the current SQL query to include both the related posts and the original post's view count in the output more clearly. 2. Instead of using 'UNION ALL', use a single query that combines results to keep all relevant information in one structured output. 3. Ensure that the result set includes a label or column for 'Popularity' to avoid ambiguity. Here’s a simplified modified SQL query: 

```
SELECT T2.Id AS RelatedPostId, T2.ViewCount AS Popularity FROM postLinks AS T1 
JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id 
WHERE T1.PostId = 61217 
UNION ALL 
SELECT 61217 AS RelatedPostId, ViewCount AS Popularity FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217;
```
4. This change presents the view counts correctly for both the related posts and the original post ID 61217 in a unified format, fulfilling the requirement to show the popularity of the specific post alongside its related posts.
8. To modify the SQL query to meet the requirements of the question, follow these steps: 
1. Ensure that the result includes the view count for post ID 61217 as part of the result set. This can be achieved by using a subquery or by applying a JOIN that explicitly includes the original post alongside the related posts.
2. Instead of using UNION ALL, use a single SELECT statement that selects the related posts as well as the specified post (ID 61217) together. 
3. Modify the final query to include '61217' in the same query context as the related posts, ensuring that the view count of the original post is correctly displayed in the result. The corrected SQL query might look something like this:

```sql
SELECT T2.Id AS RelatedPostId, T2.ViewCount AS Popularity 
FROM postLinks AS T1 
JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id 
WHERE T1.PostId = 61217 
UNION ALL 
SELECT 61217 AS RelatedPostId, ViewCount AS Popularity 
FROM posts 
WHERE Id = 61217;
``` 
4. Alternatively, consider using a JOIN to fetch both related posts and the main post in a single result: 
```sql
SELECT T2.Id AS RelatedPostId, T2.ViewCount AS Popularity 
FROM postLinks AS T1 
JOIN posts AS T2 ON T1.RelatedPostId = T2.Id 
WHERE T1.PostId = 61217 
UNION ALL 
SELECT 61217 AS RelatedPostId, ViewCount AS Popularity 
FROM posts WHERE Id = 61217;
```
5. Ensure both sets of results are handled appropriately so that you do not inadvertently omit any necessary output. The final results should reflect both the related posts and the specified post's popularity in a clear and aligned way.

Question: 
List out all post that are related to post ID 61217 and what is the popularity of this post? 

Hint:
post related refers to RelatedPostId; popularity refers to ViewCount
