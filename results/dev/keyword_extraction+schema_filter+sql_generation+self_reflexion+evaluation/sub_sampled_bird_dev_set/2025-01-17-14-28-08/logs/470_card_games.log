This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
When was the set of cards with "Ancestor's Chosen" released?

SQL Query:
SELECT S.releaseDate FROM cards AS C JOIN sets AS S ON C.uuid = S.code WHERE C.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';

Execution Result:
None

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

############################## AI at step evaluator_generate_result ##############################

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the release date of the set of cards specifically named 'Ancestor's Chosen'. The provided SQL query attempts to retrieve the release date by joining the 'cards' table with the 'sets' table on the condition that the card's name matches 'Ancestor's Chosen'. However, the execution result indicates that there were no records found (None), suggesting that either the card with that name does not exist in the database, or it exists but is not associated with any set. Therefore, the SQL query is structured properly to answer the question, but it fails to yield any data, thus not fully answering the question even though the SQL logic is sound. The answer is Invalid because while the query correctly identifies how to look for the answer, it does not return any results, which means it doesn't answer the original question.",
    "judgment": "Invalid"
}

############################## Human at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
When was the set of cards with "Ancestor's Chosen" released?

Predicted SQL:
SELECT S.releaseDate FROM cards AS C JOIN sets AS S ON C.uuid = S.code WHERE C.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';

Execution Result:
None

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': "The question asks for the release date of the set of cards specifically named 'Ancestor's Chosen'. The provided SQL query attempts to retrieve the release date by joining the 'cards' table with the 'sets' table on the condition that the card's name matches 'Ancestor's Chosen'. However, the execution result indicates that there were no records found (None), suggesting that either the card with that name does not exist in the database, or it exists but is not associated with any set.

The answer is Invalid because while the query correctly identifies how to look for the answer, it does not return any results, which means it doesn't answer the original question.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "1. Verify the Existence of the Card: Before modifying the query, check if the card 'Ancestor's Chosen' exists in the 'cards' table. If not, it may explain why the query returned no results. Use a simple query like 'SELECT * FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'' to confirm its presence. \n\n2. Check Card Association with Sets: If the card exists, ensure that it has an appropriate association with the sets in the 'sets' table. It might be possible that the card is present but does not have a valid UUID linking it to a set. \n  \n3. Modify the Query for Correct Join Conditions: If the card does exist, consider checking how the 'uuid' in the 'cards' table and the 'code' in the 'sets' table are linked. If there's a specific linking table or different fields being used to establish this relationship, adjust the JOIN clause accordingly. For example: \n   - If there's a linking table, you might need to add another JOIN to pull in the relationship. \n   \n4. Enhance Query to Capture Variants: If there is a possibility of the card existing under different names or spellings (e.g., with or without apostrophes), consider using a LIKE clause instead: \n   - Example: 'WHERE C.name LIKE '%Ancestor%Chosen%''. \n  \n5. Incorporate DISTINCT Keyword: In case multiple records for the same set might exist, use SELECT DISTINCT to ensure unique results are returned, avoiding duplicate dates in your results. \n  \n6. Validate the Data: After making the above adjustments, run the query again to check whether any results are returned and confirm that they match the expectations derived from the question."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify the Existence of the Card: Before modifying the query, check if the card 'Ancestor's Chosen' exists in the 'cards' table. If not, it may explain why the query returned no results. Use a simple query like 'SELECT * FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'' to confirm its presence. 

2. Check Card Association with Sets: If the card exists, ensure that it has an appropriate association with the sets in the 'sets' table. It might be possible that the card is present but does not have a valid UUID linking it to a set. 
  
3. Modify the Query for Correct Join Conditions: If the card does exist, consider checking how the 'uuid' in the 'cards' table and the 'code' in the 'sets' table are linked. If there's a specific linking table or different fields being used to establish this relationship, adjust the JOIN clause accordingly. For example: 
   - If there's a linking table, you might need to add another JOIN to pull in the relationship. 
   
4. Enhance Query to Capture Variants: If there is a possibility of the card existing under different names or spellings (e.g., with or without apostrophes), consider using a LIKE clause instead: 
   - Example: 'WHERE C.name LIKE '%Ancestor%Chosen%''. 
  
5. Incorporate DISTINCT Keyword: In case multiple records for the same set might exist, use SELECT DISTINCT to ensure unique results are returned, avoiding duplicate dates in your results. 
  
6. Validate the Data: After making the above adjustments, run the query again to check whether any results are returned and confirm that they match the expectations derived from the question.

The SQL query attempts to retrieve this information by joining the 'cards' and 'sets' tables based on the unique identifier for the card (C.uuid) and the code for the set (S.code). It specifically filters for cards with the name 'Ancestor's Chosen'. Unfortunately, the execution result returned 'None', indicating that no records matched the query criteria. This suggests that either 'Ancestor's Chosen' does not exist in the 'cards' table, or it exists but is not linked to any record in the 'sets' table. As a result, the SQL query did not successfully retrieve the relevant release date, and thus does not fully answer the question asked. The SQL query is, therefore, not valid in its current form since it failed to find any relevant data that answers the question.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify the Existence of the Card: Before modifying the query, check if the card 'Ancestor's Chosen' exists in the 'cards' table. If not, it may explain why the query returned no results. Use a simple query like 'SELECT * FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'' to confirm its presence. 

2. Check Card Association with Sets: If the card exists, ensure that it has an appropriate association with the sets in the 'sets' table. It might be possible that the card is present but does not have a valid UUID linking it to a set. 
  
3. Modify the Query for Correct Join Conditions: If the card does exist, consider checking how the 'uuid' in the 'cards' table and the 'code' in the 'sets' table are linked. If there's a specific linking table or different fields being used to establish this relationship, adjust the JOIN clause accordingly. For example: 
   - If there's a linking table, you might need to add another JOIN to pull in the relationship. 
   
4. Enhance Query to Capture Variants: If there is a possibility of the card existing under different names or spellings (e.g., with or without apostrophes), consider using a LIKE clause instead: 
   - Example: 'WHERE C.name LIKE '%Ancestor%Chosen%''. 
  
5. Incorporate DISTINCT Keyword: In case multiple records for the same set might exist, use SELECT DISTINCT to ensure unique results are returned, avoiding duplicate dates in your results. 
  
6. Validate the Data: After making the above adjustments, run the query again to check whether any results are returned and confirm that they match the expectations derived from the question.
7. The current SQL query is structured correctly but fails to return results because there may be no matching record for 'Ancestor's Chosen' in the cards table. To address this, perform the following steps: 1. Verify that 'Ancestor's Chosen' truly exists in the 'cards' table. You can run a simple SELECT query like 'SELECT * FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';' to check for any discrepancies in the card name, such as spelling or punctuation. 2. If there is a spelling or formatting issue, correct the name in your SQL query. 3. If the card does exist but the query still returns no results, ensure that the join condition (C.uuid = S.code) is valid and that the data in the 'sets' table is correctly linked to the 'cards' table for the specified card. 4. Depending on the results of your verification step, adjust your SQL query accordingly or investigate further to gather relevant data to meet the requirements of the original question.
8. 1. Verify the existence of the card 'Ancestor's Chosen' in the 'cards' table. You may want to run a simple SELECT query like SELECT * FROM cards WHERE name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen' to confirm that it actually exists. 2. If the card exists but still returns None in the original query, check the relationship between the 'cards' table and 'sets' table. Ensure that the uuid for 'Ancestor's Chosen' corresponds correctly to a set code in 'sets'. If necessary, consider removing the join and simply selecting from the 'cards' table to find the release date directly related to the card (if it is stored there). 3. If the release date is not housed within the 'cards' table but still want to reference this date, make sure there is a valid relationship ensuring the UUID of the cards can map correctly to a set. Your modified query could look something like: SELECT S.releaseDate FROM sets AS S JOIN cards AS C ON C.uuid = S.code WHERE C.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen' OR check C.setId if that exists.'

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT S.releaseDate FROM cards AS C JOIN sets AS S ON C.uuid = S.code WHERE C.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';", "SELECT S.releaseDate FROM cards AS C JOIN sets AS S ON C.uuid = S.code WHERE C.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';", "SELECT S.releaseDate FROM cards AS C JOIN sets AS S ON C.uuid = S.code WHERE C.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';", "SELECT S.releaseDate FROM cards AS C JOIN sets AS S ON C.uuid = S.code WHERE C.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';", "SELECT S.releaseDate FROM cards AS C JOIN sets AS S ON C.uuid = S.code WHERE C.name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen';"]

Question: 
When was the set of cards with "Ancestor's Chosen" released? 

Hint:
card set "Ancestor's Chosen" refers to name = 'Ancestor''s Chosen'; when released refers to releaseDate

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To find the release date of the set of cards with 'Ancestor's Chosen', I first need to ensure that the card exists in the 'cards' table. The column in queries must be validated, ensuring it is pulling from the correct fields. The relevant columns for this query are 'name' from the 'cards' table and 'releaseDate' from the 'sets' table. To connect these tables, I will use 'uuid' from 'cards' and 'code' from 'sets', as they form the relationship between the two tables.

I will also check the existence of 'Ancestor's Chosen' with a simple SELECT statement to prevent issues from non-existing records.
