This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score.

SQL Query:
SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM posts T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T1.ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1.Score DESC LIMIT 1;

Execution Result:
(None,)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",

Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score.

Predicted SQL:

Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. **Select the Correct Columns**: Ensure the query selects the display name of the parent post after identifying the child post with the highest score. Modify the SELECT statement to: SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName. 2. **Identify the Highest Scoring Child Post**: Currently, the query orders child posts by score but doesn't group the results intelligently. Instead, use a nested SELECT statement or a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first find the child post with the highest score. For example: 'WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT T1.Score, T1.ParentId FROM posts T1 WHERE T1.ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1.Score DESC LIMIT 1)'. 3. **Join with Parent Posts**: Then, join this CTE with the original posts table to retrieve the parent\u2019s display name, ensuring the proper linkage to parent posts. Combine the results: 'SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id'. 4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Keep in mind that if no posts or child posts exist, the result will still be (None,), indicating underlying data issues. 5. **Final Query Structure**: Compile the steps into a final SQL structure, such as: 'WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT ParentId FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id;'.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. **Select the Correct Columns**: Ensure the query selects the display name of the parent post after identifying the child post with the highest score. Modify the SELECT statement to: SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName. 2. **Identify the Highest Scoring Child Post**: Currently, the query orders child posts by score but doesn't group the results intelligently. Instead, use a nested SELECT statement or a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first find the child post with the highest score. For example: 'WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT T1.Score, T1.ParentId FROM posts T1 WHERE T1.ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1.Score DESC LIMIT 1)'. 3. **Join with Parent Posts**: Then, join this CTE with the original posts table to retrieve the parent’s display name, ensuring the proper linkage to parent posts. Combine the results: 'SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id'. 4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Keep in mind that if no posts or child posts exist, the result will still be (None,), indicating underlying data issues. 5. **Final Query Structure**: Compile the steps into a final SQL structure, such as: 'WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT ParentId FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id;'. This ensures the query meets the requirement to describe the parent of the highest-scoring child post.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. **Select the Correct Columns**: Ensure the query selects the display name of the parent post after identifying the child post with the highest score. Modify the SELECT statement to: SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName. 2. **Identify the Highest Scoring Child Post**: Currently, the query orders child posts by score but doesn't group the results intelligently.

This ensures the query meets the requirement to describe the parent of the highest-scoring child post.
7. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure that you are correctly capturing the child post with the highest score. The current subquery in the `WITH` clause should remain as it is, since it properly identifies this post. 2. Check if the selected child post actually has a valid parent post.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. **Select the Correct Columns**: Ensure the query selects the display name of the parent post after identifying the child post with the highest score. Modify the SELECT statement to: SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName. 2. **Identify the Highest Scoring Child Post**: Currently, the query orders child posts by score but doesn't group the results intelligently. Instead, use a nested SELECT statement or a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first find the child post with the highest score. For example: 'WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT T1.Score, T1.ParentId FROM posts T1 WHERE T1.ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1.Score DESC LIMIT 1)'. 3. **Join with Parent Posts**: Then, join this CTE with the original posts table to retrieve the parent’s display name, ensuring the proper linkage to parent posts. Combine the results: 'SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id'. 4. **Consider Edge Cases**: Keep in mind that if no posts or child posts exist, the result will still be (None,), indicating underlying data issues. 5. **Final Query Structure**: Compile the steps into a final SQL structure, such as: 'WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT ParentId FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id;'. This ensures the query meets the requirement to describe the parent of the highest-scoring child post.
7. To modify the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure that you are correctly capturing the child post with the highest score. The current subquery in the `WITH` clause should remain as it is, since it properly identifies this post. 2. Check if the selected child post actually has a valid parent post. You may want to avoid any situation where the child post ends up being an orphan (i.e., no valid ParentId entry). Add a check in the final SELECT statement to ensure you only join with the parent post if it exists. 3. Add a condition that ensures there is a parent post for the identified highest score child post. Update the final SQL to something like this: `WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T2.Id IS NOT NULL;` This will ensure that you only retrieve results when there is a valid parent. If there are no parents in the dataset, the query should return an appropriate message or indicate that there's no parent associated with the highest score child post. This aligns the output with the intended question better.
8. 1. Modify the CTE (Common Table Expression) 'HighestScorePost' to explicitly select only the necessary columns from the posts table, particularly the ParentId and Score, rather than using SELECT *. This will improve performance and clarity. 

2. Ensure that the query correctly filters for child posts by confirming that there are actually posts in the database with non-null ParentId values. If there are no child posts, consider adding a mechanism to handle this case, such as returning a specific message or default value when no records are found. 

3. In the main SELECT statement, instead of filtering for T2.Id where it is not NULL, you should directly join the posts table using the ParentId from the 'HighestScorePost' CTE to ensure you're retrieving the correct display name for the parent associated with the highest scoring child post. 

4. Lastly, consider adding a check for situations where there are child posts but no corresponding parent, and handle this case appropriately, either by returning NULL or a message indicating the absence of a parent post.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
['SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM posts T1 JOIN posts T2 ON T1.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T1.ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY T1.Score DESC LIMIT 1;', 'WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id;', 'WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id;', 'WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T2.Id IS NOT NULL;', 'WITH HighestScorePost AS (SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ParentId IS NOT NULL ORDER BY Score DESC LIMIT 1) SELECT T2.OwnerDisplayName FROM HighestScorePost HSP JOIN posts T2 ON HSP.ParentId = T2.Id WHERE T2.Id IS NOT NULL;']

Question: 
Describe the display name of the parent ID for child post with the highest score. 

Hint:
If the parent id is not null, the post is the child post; the highest score refers to MAX(Score);

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
