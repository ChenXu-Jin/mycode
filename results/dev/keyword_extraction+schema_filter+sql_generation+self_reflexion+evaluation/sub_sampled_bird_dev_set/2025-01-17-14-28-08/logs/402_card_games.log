This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
What is the percentage of Story Spotlight cards that also have a text box? List them by their ID.

SQL Query:
SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN id END) * 100.0 / COUNT(id)) AS percentage FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1;

Execution Result:
(100.0,)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the percentage of Story Spotlight cards that have a text box, and it requests the output to be listed by their ID. The SQL query is measuring the percentage of cards identified as 'Story Spotlight' (where isStorySpotlight = 1) that are textless (indicated by isTextless = 0). However, it does not explicitly mention the condition for identifying cards that have a text box, which would likely require that isTextless = 1. Additionally, the SQL query lacks the requested output of the IDs themselves; it only returns the percentage. Therefore, the SQL query does not correctly and fully respond to the question, as it fails to list the IDs and properly aligns with the condition related to text boxes.",

}

############################## Human at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
What is the percentage of Story Spotlight cards that also have a text box? List them by their ID.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN id END) * 100.0 / COUNT(id)) AS percentage FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1;

Execution Result:

Therefore, the SQL query does not correctly and fully respond to the question, as it fails to list the IDs and properly aligns with the condition related to text boxes.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "1. Modify the SQL query to correctly identify and include cards that have a text box, which should be represented by the condition 'isTextless = 1'. 2. Ensure that you are counting only those cards that are both 'Story Spotlight' (isStorySpotlight = 1) and have a text box (isTextless = 1). 3. Include the card IDs in the output. You can achieve this by selecting the IDs directly while also calculating the percentage. 4. Consider using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first isolate the Story Spotlight cards and then filter them by text box status. Here's a refined structure for your SQL query:\n\n```sql\nWITH spotlight_cards AS (\n    SELECT id, isTextless \n    FROM cards \n    WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1\n) \nSELECT \n    COUNT(*) AS text_box_count, \n    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM spotlight_cards) AS percentage, \n    id \nFROM spotlight_cards \nWHERE isTextless = 1 \nGROUP BY id;\n``` \n5. This construction clearly separates the counting logic from the IDs, while ensuring the output includes the IDs of the relevant cards and the percentage calculated as requested."

Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Modify the SQL query to correctly identify and include cards that have a text box, which should be represented by the condition 'isTextless = 1'. 2. Ensure that you are counting only those cards that are both 'Story Spotlight' (isStorySpotlight = 1) and have a text box (isTextless = 1). 3. Include the card IDs in the output. You can achieve this by selecting the IDs directly while also calculating the percentage. 4. Consider using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first isolate the Story Spotlight cards and then filter them by text box status. Here's a refined structure for your SQL query:

```sql
WITH spotlight_cards AS (
    SELECT id, isTextless 
    FROM cards 
    WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1
) 
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS text_box_count, 
    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM spotlight_cards) AS percentage, 
    id 
FROM spotlight_cards 
WHERE isTextless = 1 
GROUP BY id;
``` 
5. This construction clearly separates the counting logic from the IDs, while ensuring the output includes the IDs of the relevant cards and the percentage calculated as requested.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
What is the percentage of Story Spotlight cards that also have a text box? List them by their ID.

Predicted SQL:
WITH spotlight_cards AS (
    SELECT id, isTextless 
    FROM cards 
    WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1
) 
SELECT 
    id, 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS percentage 
FROM spotlight_cards 
WHERE isTextless = 0 
GROUP BY id;

Execution Result:
(4569, 100.0)

Evaluation Result:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Modify the SQL query to correctly identify and include cards that have a text box, which should be represented by the condition 'isTextless = 1'. 2. Ensure that you are counting only those cards that are both 'Story Spotlight' (isStorySpotlight = 1) and have a text box (isTextless = 1). 3. Include the card IDs in the output. You can achieve this by selecting the IDs directly while also calculating the percentage. 4. Consider using a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first isolate the Story Spotlight cards and then filter them by text box status. Here's a refined structure for your SQL query:

```sql
WITH spotlight_cards AS (
    SELECT id, isTextless 
    FROM cards 
    WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1
) 
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS text_box_count, 
    COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM spotlight_cards) AS percentage, 
    id 
FROM spotlight_cards 
WHERE isTextless = 1 
GROUP BY id;
``` 
5. This construction clearly separates the counting logic from the IDs, while ensuring the output includes the IDs of the relevant cards and the percentage calculated as requested.
7. 1. Modify the WHERE clause in the SQL query to select cards that have a text box instead of those that are textless. Change 'WHERE isTextless = 1' to 'WHERE isTextless = 0' to correctly filter for Story Spotlight cards that do have a text box. 

2. To achieve the desired output of listing the IDs of Story Spotlight cards along with the percentage, consider restructuring the query. Instead of grouping by 'id', calculate the total count of text box cards separately after identifying them, and retain the necessary information from 'spotlight_cards'. 

3. Include the IDs of the relevant Story Spotlight cards in the SELECT statement. This can be achieved by adjusting the output to include the IDs directly from the 'spotlight_cards' CTE without grouping by ID. You may want to use a JOIN with an aggregated count or use window functions to list card IDs while still calculating the percentage in a separate part of the result.

4. Lastly, ensure that the output contains the calculated percentage as an additional column if that's a requirement alongside the list of IDs. This can involve adding another query for calculation or modifying the current one to incorporate both outputs appropriately.
8. To align the SQL query with the intent of the question, follow these specific steps: 1. **Aggregate Overall Data**: Instead of grouping by ID, change the grouping to aggregate all Story Spotlight cards, allowing for a calculation of the overall percentage. 2. **Change the SELECT Statement**: Modify the SELECT statement to return just a single output showing the overall percentage instead of individual IDs. 3. **Include All Story Spotlight IDs**: If the IDs of the Story Spotlight cards need to be returned alongside their percentage, consider using a subquery to get this ID list separately, while computing the percentage in the main query. 4. **Correct Logic for Textbox Counting**: Ensure that the Calculation of the percentage includes a count of all Story Spotlight cards for the denominator, instead of exclusively counting non-textless cards. 5. **Revise the Final Output**: The final output should indicate the percentage of all Story Spotlight cards that have a text box, instead of percentages based on individual IDs. Here’s an example of how the revised SQL might look: 

   WITH spotlight_cards AS (
       SELECT id, isTextless 
       FROM cards 
       WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1
   ) 
   SELECT 
       COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS percentage
   FROM spotlight_cards;

Short-Term Memory:

['SELECT (COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN id END) * 100.0 / COUNT(id)) AS percentage FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1;', 'WITH spotlight_cards AS (SELECT id, isTextless FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1) SELECT COUNT(*) AS text_box_count, COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM spotlight_cards) AS percentage, id FROM spotlight_cards WHERE isTextless = 1 GROUP BY id;', 'WITH spotlight_cards AS (SELECT id, isTextless FROM cards WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1) SELECT COUNT(*) AS text_box_count, COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM spotlight_cards) AS percentage, id FROM spotlight_cards WHERE isTextless = 1 GROUP BY id;', 'WITH spotlight_cards AS (\n    SELECT id, isTextless \n    FROM cards \n    WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1\n) \nSELECT \n    id, \n    COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS percentage \nFROM spotlight_cards \nWHERE isTextless = 0 \nGROUP BY id;', 'WITH spotlight_cards AS (\n    SELECT id, isTextless \n    FROM cards \n    WHERE isStorySpotlight = 1\n) \nSELECT \n    id, \n    COUNT(CASE WHEN isTextless = 0 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) AS percentage \nFROM spotlight_cards \nWHERE isTextless = 0 \nGROUP BY id;']

Question: 
What is the percentage of Story Spotlight cards that also have a text box? List them by their ID. 

Hint:
Story Spotlight cards that do not have a text box refers to isStorylight = 1 and isTextless = 1; Percentage refer to DIVIDE(SUM(count(id) where isStorylight = 1), SUM(count(id))) * 100
