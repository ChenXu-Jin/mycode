You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE customers (
  CustomerID INTEGER UNIQUE     not null
        primary key,
  Segment    TEXT null,
  Currency   TEXT null
);

CREATE TABLE gasstations (
  GasStationID INTEGER    UNIQUE   not null
        primary key,
  ChainID      INTEGER          null,
  Country      TEXT null,
  Segment      TEXT null
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  ProductID   INTEGER   UNIQUE      not null
        primary key,
  Description TEXT null
);

CREATE TABLE transactions_1k (
  TransactionID INTEGER
        primary key autoincrement,
  Date          DATE,
  Time          TEXT,
  CustomerID    INTEGER,
  CardID        INTEGER,
  GasStationID  INTEGER,
  ProductID     INTEGER,
  Amount        INTEGER,
  Price         REAL
);

CREATE TABLE yearmonth (
  CustomerID  INTEGER not null
        references customers
            on update cascade on delete cascade
        references customers,
  Date        TEXT    not null,
  Consumption REAL,
  primary key (Date, CustomerID)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

  Date        TEXT    not null,
  Consumption REAL,
  primary key (Date, CustomerID)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify Data Availability: Before modifying the query, ensure that there are customers in the 'customers' table with Currency set to 'euro', and that these customers have corresponding entries in the 'transactions_1k' table. Run basic checks to confirm there is data for these filters. If no records exist, the query will always return (None,).

2. Modify Join Logic: Instead of using a nested query to filter transactions separately, consider using a JOIN between the 'customers' and 'transactions_1k' tables to directly link customers who paid in euros to their transactions. This will help ensure that you're only processing relevant transaction data.

3. SQL Query Adjustment: Update the SQL query structure as follows:
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(T1.Price) 
   FROM transactions_1k T1 
   JOIN customers C ON T1.CustomerID = C.CustomerID 
   WHERE C.Currency = 'euro';
   ```  
   This way, you're averaging the prices directly from the transactions of customers paying in euros and ensuring the query is optimized.

4. Check for NULL Values: Ensure that your queried dataset does not contain NULL values affecting AVG calculations. Consider using a WHERE clause to filter out transactions where Price is NULL, if necessary.

5. Validate Output: After running the adjusted query, validate that you receive a meaningful average. If the result is still (None,) check the currencies and transactions again.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify Data Availability: Before modifying the query, ensure that there are customers in the 'customers' table with Currency set to 'euro', and that these customers have corresponding entries in the 'transactions_1k' table. Run basic checks to confirm there is data for these filters. If no records exist, the query will always return (None,).

2. Modify Join Logic: Instead of using a nested query to filter transactions separately, consider using a JOIN between the 'customers' and 'transactions_1k' tables to directly link customers who paid in euros to their transactions. This will help ensure that you're only processing relevant transaction data.

3. SQL Query Adjustment: Update the SQL query structure as follows:
   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(T1.Price) 
   FROM transactions_1k T1 
   JOIN customers C ON T1.CustomerID = C.CustomerID 
   WHERE C.Currency = 'euro';
   ```  
   This way, you're averaging the prices directly from the transactions of customers paying in euros and ensuring the query is optimized.

4. Check for NULL Values: Ensure that your queried dataset does not contain NULL values affecting AVG calculations. Consider using a WHERE clause to filter out transactions where Price is NULL, if necessary.

5. Validate Output: After running the adjusted query, validate that you receive a meaningful average. If the result is still (None,) check the currencies and transactions again.
7. 1. Ensure there are transactions for customers using euros: Verify that there are records in the transactions_1k and customers tables for customers with 'euro' as their currency. If there are no such records, the query will return None. You may need to run a simple SELECT query to check whether there are any customers with 'euro' as their currency, and if they have transactions. 

2. Modify the query to include a broader condition for 'currency': If you want to include various forms of euro (e.g., 'EUR'), ensure that your WHERE clause accommodates those variations. You might use a CASE or an IN clause if there are multiple currencies labeled under euro. 

3. Verify transaction presence: Check whether T1.Price is not NULL, but ensure you are also validating the transaction records related to the euros condition in the customer table. 

4. Correct the aggregation: If you want the average of total transactions, consider adjusting the averaging method. Since you want to calculate the average price per euro-customer transaction, ensure to correctly calculate the average after confirming data exists. The current GROUP BY is valid, but confirm prices exist for those records. If sums are required for aggregation but no prices exist, the output will remain None. 

Example of a revised query might look like this:

"SELECT AVG(total_price) FROM (SELECT T1.CustomerID, SUM(T1.Price) AS total_price 
FROM transactions_1k T1 
JOIN customers C ON T1.CustomerID = C.CustomerID 
WHERE C.Currency IN ('euro', 'EUR') AND T1.Price IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY T1.CustomerID) T2 WHERE total_price > 0;"
