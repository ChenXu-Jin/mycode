This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

It may simply be that there are no records matching these criteria. If there are records with different heights or races, you may want to adjust the criteria based on actual data available.\n2. Adjust Height Condition: If the criteria need to accommodate slight variations, consider using a range for height instead of an exact match (e.g., T1.height_cm BETWEEN 180 AND 190) to capture a broader dataset. This will help identify if there are any human superheroes who are around the height of 185 cm.\n3. Review Joining Logic: Ensure that the identifiers being used to join the superhero, race, and colour tables are accurate. Validate that T1.race_id in the superhero table correctly corresponds to T2.id in the race table, and T1.hair_colour_id corresponds to T3.id in the colour table.\n4. Add Additional Filtering: If there are multiple entries for human superheroes, consider adding more filters to narrow down results, such as other distinguishing superhero attributes, to ensure that results are relevant.\n5.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify Data Existence: Before modifying the SQL query, check the database to ensure there are indeed entries for human superheroes who are 185 cm tall. It may simply be that there are no records matching these criteria. If there are records with different heights or races, you may want to adjust the criteria based on actual data available.

This will help identify if there are any human superheroes who are around the height of 185 cm.
3. Review Joining Logic: Ensure that the identifiers being used to join the superhero, race, and colour tables are accurate. Validate that T1.race_id in the superhero table correctly corresponds to T2.id in the race table, and T1.hair_colour_id corresponds to T3.id in the colour table.

This indicates that two primary conditions must be satisfied: the superhero must be human and must have a height of 185 cm. Next, I reviewed the SQL query which selects the hair color from a table of superheroes. It joins three tables: 'superhero', 'race', and 'colour', to filter the results based on the superhero's height and race. The conditions `T1.height_cm = 185 AND T2.race = 'human'` target the specific superhero described in the question. However, the execution result is 'None,' indicating that either there are no records that meet the criteria or the query did not correctly find the data. Hence, while the SQL query is structured correctly to retrieve the required information given the question, the fact that no result was returned means that it does not fully satisfy the question's intent, which seeks a specific output. Thus, the query is invalid due to not yielding any applicable results even if it was logically aligned with the question.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify Data Existence: Before modifying the SQL query, check the database to ensure there are indeed entries for human superheroes who are 185 cm tall. It may simply be that there are no records matching these criteria. If there are records with different heights or races, you may want to adjust the criteria based on actual data available.
2. Adjust Height Condition: If the criteria need to accommodate slight variations, consider using a range for height instead of an exact match (e.g., T1.height_cm BETWEEN 180 AND 190) to capture a broader dataset. This will help identify if there are any human superheroes who are around the height of 185 cm.
3. Review Joining Logic: Ensure that the identifiers being used to join the superhero, race, and colour tables are accurate. Validate that T1.race_id in the superhero table correctly corresponds to T2.id in the race table, and T1.hair_colour_id corresponds to T3.id in the colour table.
4. Add Additional Filtering: If there are multiple entries for human superheroes, consider adding more filters to narrow down results, such as other distinguishing superhero attributes, to ensure that results are relevant.
5. Test Query with Broader Filters: As a troubleshooting step, run a modified query without the height filter, to see if any human superheroes return data at all. Example SQL: SELECT T3.colour FROM superhero AS T1 JOIN race AS T2 ON T1.race_id = T2.id JOIN colour AS T3 ON T1.hair_colour_id = T3.id WHERE T2.race = 'human'; If results return without the height filter, gradually reintroduce the height condition.
6. Log and Analyze: Lastly, log the results and analyze any varying data for potential entries that are either missing or misclassified. This analysis might reveal fundamental issues with how data is logged in the database itself.
7. 1. **Confirm the Data Presence**: Before modifying the SQL query, check the database to ensure that there actually exists a superhero with a height of 185 cm and a race of 'human'. Lack of results can arise if the data is not present rather than query issues. 

2. **Verify Column Names**: Ensure that the column names in the SQL query are correctly spelled and match the conventions used in your database schema, especially the 'race' column in the 'race' table and any related identifiers. A mismatch in naming could lead to no results being found. 

3. **Modify JOIN Clause**: If necessary, review how the tables are joined. Ensure that the foreign keys (race_id and hair_colour_id) correctly point to valid entries in the respective tables. 

4. **Add Additional Filter Verification**: Consider adding a clause to show the unique id and attributes of the superheroes you're filtering. This may aid in debugging: Use 'SELECT T1.id, T1.name, T1.height_cm, T2.race, T3.colour' to see what records are being retrieved during your query construction process. 

5. **Execute with Broader Conditions**: Temporarily broaden the height filter (e.g., remove the height condition) to verify that human superheroes exist in the table: 'SELECT T1.id, T1.name, T2.race FROM superhero AS T1 JOIN race AS T2 ON T1.race_id = T2.id WHERE T2.race = 'human''. 

6. **Refine Final Query**: Assuming records exist, revert back to the precise query but ensure the filtered conditions are correctly operational: 
   `SELECT T3.colour FROM superhero AS T1 JOIN race AS T2 ON T1.race_id = T2.id JOIN colour AS T3 ON T1.hair_colour_id = T3.id WHERE T1.height_cm = 185 AND T2.race = 'human';`

I must ensure that the superhero is classified as a human by joining the 'race' table and filtering the results where 'race' equals 'human'. 3. To obtain the hair colour, I will join the 'colour' table using the 'hair_colour_id' from the 'superhero' table. 4. Since the question specifies to return the hair colour, I will select the 'colour' column from the 'colour' table. 5. I'll include necessary joins while following the given database administration instructions to ensure optimal query structure. I'll use aliases for tables for simplicity and clarity.

Question: 
Provide the hair colour of the human superhero who is 185 cm tall. 

Hint:
185 cm tall refers to height_cm = 185; human superhero refers to race = 'human'; hair colour refers to colour where hair_colour_id = colour.id;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

3. **Modify JOIN Clause**: If necessary, review how the tables are joined. Ensure that the foreign keys (race_id and hair_colour_id) correctly point to valid entries in the respective tables. 

4. **Add Additional Filter Verification**: Consider adding a clause to show the unique id and attributes of the superheroes you're filtering. This may aid in debugging: Use 'SELECT T1.id, T1.name, T1.height_cm, T2.race, T3.colour' to see what records are being retrieved during your query construction process.

Include More Information: If possible, add more context to the query, such as including additional columns or conditions that can help in narrowing down the search without excluding potential matches. 5. Test with Broader Conditions: Modify the query to check for superhero heights near 185 cm and non-specific humans first, to ensure that data retrieval is functioning correctly before reapplying the strict conditions: SELECT T3.colour FROM superhero AS T1 JOIN race AS T2 ON T1.race_id = T2.id JOIN colour AS T3 ON T1.hair_colour_id = T3.id WHERE T2.race = 'human' AND T1.height_cm IS NOT NULL; This will help identify if the issue lies with the specific height condition.

Question: 
Provide the hair colour of the human superhero who is 185 cm tall. 

Hint:
185 cm tall refers to height_cm = 185; human superhero refers to race = 'human'; hair colour refers to colour where hair_colour_id = colour.id;

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To construct the SQL query to find the hair color of the human superhero who is 185 cm tall, I started by identifying the relevant tables and their relationships based on the provided database schema. The primary table for superheroes is 'superhero'. I need to extract the 'hair_colour_id' which links to the 'colour' table. We also need to confirm that the superhero belongs to the race 'human', which is connected through the 'race' table. The filters applied include checking for a height of 185 cm and ensuring the race is 'human'. I will use JOIN statements to connect these tables effectively, ensuring that we only include the relevant columns. Based on this information, the SQL query will select the hair color from the 'colour' table. Since the goal is to find a specific superhero by height and race, I will include the necessary WHERE conditions. Therefore, the final SQL query will effectively return the hair color of the superhero who meets these criteria.",
