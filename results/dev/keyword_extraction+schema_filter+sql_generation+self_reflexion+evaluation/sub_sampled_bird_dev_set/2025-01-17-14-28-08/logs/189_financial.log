This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Name the account numbers of female clients who are oldest and have lowest average salary?

SQL Query:
SELECT DISTINCT T4.account_id FROM client AS T1 JOIN district AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id JOIN disp AS T3 ON T1.client_id = T3.client_id JOIN account AS T4 ON T3.account_id = T4.account_id WHERE T1.gender = 'F' AND T1.birth_date = (SELECT MIN(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') AND T2.A11 = (SELECT MIN(A11) FROM district);

Execution Result:
None

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Update the condition for age: Instead of using MIN(birth_date), change it to MAX(birth_date) in the WHERE clause to select the oldest female clients. The condition should be `WHERE T1.gender = 'F' AND T1.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F')`. 

2. Calculate the average salary: Introduce a GROUP BY clause to compute the average salary for all female clients. You can create a CTE (Common Table Expression) or a subquery that selects the account_id and the average salary for female clients and groups by account_id. 

3. Add a filtering condition for the lowest average salary: In your main query, after obtaining the average salary, filter down the results to only include account numbers belonging to female clients whose average salary matches the lowest average salary. This could be done using another subquery like `WHERE average_salary = (SELECT MIN(average_salary) FROM ( ... ))`. 

4. Ensure proper joins: Make sure that all necessary relationships among the tables are correctly set up and that you're fetching relevant data from the join operations based on the account details after computing average salaries. 

This will ensure your query accurately reflects the criteria set forth in the question, namely the oldest female clients with the lowest average salaries.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Name the account numbers of female clients who are oldest and have lowest average salary?

SQL Query:
SELECT DISTINCT T4.account_id FROM client AS T1 JOIN district AS T2 ON T1.district_id = T2.district_id JOIN disp AS T3 ON T1.client_id = T3.client_id JOIN account AS T4 ON T3.account_id = T4.account_id WHERE T1.gender = 'F' AND T1.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F') AND T2.A11 = (SELECT MIN(A11) FROM district);

Execution Result:
None

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Update the condition for age: Instead of using MIN(birth_date), change it to MAX(birth_date) in the WHERE clause to select the oldest female clients. The condition should be `WHERE T1.gender = 'F' AND T1.birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F')`. 

2. Calculate the average salary: Introduce a GROUP BY clause to compute the average salary for all female clients. You can create a CTE (Common Table Expression) or a subquery that selects the account_id and the average salary for female clients and groups by account_id. 

3. Add a filtering condition for the lowest average salary: In your main query, after obtaining the average salary, filter down the results to only include account numbers belonging to female clients whose average salary matches the lowest average salary. This could be done using another subquery like `WHERE average_salary = (SELECT MIN(average_salary) FROM ( ... ))`. 

4. Ensure proper joins: Make sure that all necessary relationships among the tables are correctly set up and that you're fetching relevant data from the join operations based on the account details after computing average salaries. 

This will ensure your query accurately reflects the criteria set forth in the question, namely the oldest female clients with the lowest average salaries.
7. To modify the SQL query so that it correctly aligns with the question's intent, follow these steps: 
1. **Identify the Oldest Female Clients**: The current query effectively identifies the oldest female clients using `MAX(birth_date)`. However, ensure that you also retrieve all records from the client table that match this birth date. Consider using a CTE (Common Table Expression) or a subquery that selects all female clients having the maximum birth date. 

2. **Calculate Average Salary**: Introduce an aggregation step to find the average salary of all female clients. This requires computing the average from the salary data associated with the clients. Modify the query to include a `GROUP BY` clause to group by each client’s account and ensure that you calculate the average salary for each gender. 

3. **Find Lowest Average Salary**: After calculating the average salaries for the female clients, you need to filter these results to find the lowest average salary. This can be done with another aggregate function in a subquery to find the minimum average salary. 

4. **Final Query Structure**: The final SQL structure should be such that it combines these computations. For example:
```sql
WITH OldestFemaleClients AS (
    SELECT account_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM client
    JOIN account AS T4 ON client.client_id = T4.account_id
    WHERE gender = 'F'
    AND birth_date = (SELECT MAX(birth_date) FROM client WHERE gender = 'F')
    GROUP BY account_id
) 
SELECT account_id 
FROM OldestFemaleClients
WHERE avg_salary = (SELECT MIN(avg_salary) FROM OldestFemaleClients);
``` 
5. **Review for Edge Cases**: Ensure to validate that your average salary calculation is robust against cases where clients may not have any salary data available. This may potentially return null values which should be handled appropriately.
