);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Remove the 'LIMIT 5' clause: Currently, the query limits the results to only one row. To ensure you capture more names based on the requirement, remove this limit. However, ensure that you handle cases where fewer than five names exist afterward.

2. Check for data availability: If the query consistently returns fewer than five names, investigate the data in the 'superhero' and 'colour' tables to confirm whether there are sufficient entries with blue eyes. 

3. Change the query to ensure it can provide all names with blue eyes: Modify the query to a SELECT statement without limits and instead handle fewer records as needed in the application logic.

4. Double-check the join condition: Ensure that the associated 'eye_colour_id' in the superhero table accurately relates to the colour table, confirming that this join will produce complete and valid results.

5. Add a group or order clause if applicable: If you want a random sample of superheroes or an ordered list, consider using ORDER BY for consistent results in future queries, especially if you need to return multiple results consistently.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Remove the 'LIMIT 5' clause: Currently, the query limits the results to only one row. To ensure you capture more names based on the requirement, remove this limit. However, ensure that you handle cases where fewer than five names exist afterward.

2. Check for data availability: If the query consistently returns fewer than five names, investigate the data in the 'superhero' and 'colour' tables to confirm whether there are sufficient entries with blue eyes. 

3. Change the query to ensure it can provide all names with blue eyes: Modify the query to a SELECT statement without limits and instead handle fewer records as needed in the application logic.

4. Double-check the join condition: Ensure that the associated 'eye_colour_id' in the superhero table accurately relates to the colour table, confirming that this join will produce complete and valid results.

5. Add a group or order clause if applicable: If you want a random sample of superheroes or an ordered list, consider using ORDER BY for consistent results in future queries, especially if you need to return multiple results consistently.
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent of listing at least five full names of superheroes with blue eyes, you can take the following steps: 1. **Check for More Data**: Ensure there are enough superheroes with blue eyes in the 'superhero' and 'colour' tables. If there are fewer than five records, the query will naturally return less than five results. 2. **Adjust the SQL Query**: Implement a 'LIMIT' clause to specify a minimum of five results if available. The modified SQL can look like this: `SELECT T1.full_name FROM superhero AS T1 INNER JOIN colour AS T2 ON T1.eye_colour_id = T2.id WHERE T2.colour = 'Blue' LIMIT 5;` 3. **Consider Duplicates**: If there might be duplicates in the data, use the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure unique names: `SELECT DISTINCT T1.full_name FROM superhero AS T1 INNER JOIN colour AS T2 ON T1.eye_colour_id = T2.id WHERE T2.colour = 'Blue' LIMIT 5;`. 4. **Check Data Integrity**: If the output is still limited when you expect more results, investigate the data in both the 'superhero' and 'colour' tables to confirm their integrity and that they contain the expected entries for blue eyes.
