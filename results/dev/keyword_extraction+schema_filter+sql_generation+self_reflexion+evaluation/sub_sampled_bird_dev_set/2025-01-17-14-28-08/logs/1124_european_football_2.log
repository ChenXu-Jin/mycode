This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Who are the players that tend to be attacking when their mates were doing attack moves? List down their name.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.player_name FROM Player T1 JOIN Player_Attributes T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T2.attacking_work_rate = 'high'

Execution Result:
('Aaron Cresswell',)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "To align the SQL query with the question's intent of identifying players who tend to be attacking when their teammates execute attacking moves, consider the following modifications: 1. **Add a condition for teammates\u2019 attacking work rates:** Since the question requires players who are attacking when their teammates are also engaged in attacking moves, include a JOIN that checks for teammates' high attacking work rates. This could be done by adding another table reference that represents teammates in conjunction with the existing player attributes. 2. **Utilize a more complex JOIN structure:** You might need to create self-joins on the Player table to relate players to their teammates. For example, join the Player table again, assigning it a different alias (e.g., T3), while ensuring you can evaluate the relationship of two players' attacking actions. 3. **Consider play statistics:** If available, consider incorporating a table that captures actual game events to assess scenarios where players attack during teammates' attacking events, which could provide more context to the query. 4. **Update the SELECT statement:** The output should reflect both the players' names and ensure you specify filtering criteria for both players' attacking work rates. 5. **Refine the WHERE clause:** The WHERE clause should include conditions for both the original players' high attacking work rate, as well as confirming that their teammates are also rated high in this attribute. This means a more nuanced filtering criteria that relates one player's attacking context to another's actions. By incorporating these adjustments, the query will better capture the essence of the question, ensuring it identifies players based not just on their own attributes, but also how they interplay with their teammates' actions."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of identifying players who tend to be attacking when their teammates execute attacking moves, consider the following modifications: 1. **Add a condition for teammates’ attacking work rates:** Since the question requires players who are attacking when their teammates are also engaged in attacking moves, include a JOIN that checks for teammates' high attacking work rates. This could be done by adding another table reference that represents teammates in conjunction with the existing player attributes. 2. **Utilize a more complex JOIN structure:** You might need to create self-joins on the Player table to relate players to their teammates. For example, join the Player table again, assigning it a different alias (e.g., T3), while ensuring you can evaluate the relationship of two players' attacking actions. 3. **Consider play statistics:** If available, consider incorporating a table that captures actual game events to assess scenarios where players attack during teammates' attacking events, which could provide more context to the query. 4. **Update the SELECT statement:** The output should reflect both the players' names and ensure you specify filtering criteria for both players' attacking work rates. 5. **Refine the WHERE clause:** The WHERE clause should include conditions for both the original players' high attacking work rate, as well as confirming that their teammates are also rated high in this attribute. This means a more nuanced filtering criteria that relates one player's attacking context to another's actions. By incorporating these adjustments, the query will better capture the essence of the question, ensuring it identifies players based not just on their own attributes, but also how they interplay with their teammates' actions.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Who are the players that tend to be attacking when their mates were doing attack moves? List down their name.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.player_name FROM Player T1 JOIN Player_Attributes T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T2.attacking_work_rate = 'high'

Execution Result:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent of identifying players who tend to be attacking when their teammates execute attacking moves, consider the following modifications: 1. **Add a condition for teammates’ attacking work rates:** Since the question requires players who are attacking when their teammates are also engaged in attacking moves, include a JOIN that checks for teammates' high attacking work rates. This could be done by adding another table reference that represents teammates in conjunction with the existing player attributes. 2. **Utilize a more complex JOIN structure:** You might need to create self-joins on the Player table to relate players to their teammates. For example, join the Player table again, assigning it a different alias (e.g., T3), while ensuring you can evaluate the relationship of two players' attacking actions. 3. **Consider play statistics:** If available, consider incorporating a table that captures actual game events to assess scenarios where players attack during teammates' attacking events, which could provide more context to the query. 4. **Update the SELECT statement:** The output should reflect both the players' names and ensure you specify filtering criteria for both players' attacking work rates. 5. **Refine the WHERE clause:** The WHERE clause should include conditions for both the original players' high attacking work rate, as well as confirming that their teammates are also rated high in this attribute. This means a more nuanced filtering criteria that relates one player's attacking context to another's actions. By incorporating these adjustments, the query will better capture the essence of the question, ensuring it identifies players based not just on their own attributes, but also how they interplay with their teammates' actions.
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the intent of the question, you will need to focus on the following steps: 
1. **Incorporate a condition for teammates' attack moves**: The query should consider players who are involved in attacking actions alongside their teammates. This may require referencing a table that logs player actions during matches and determining if teammates were executing attack moves simultaneously. 

2. **Add joins or subqueries as necessary**: Depending on your database schema, you may need to join another table that tracks match events or player actions (e.g., Player_Actions), where you can evaluate if the action type relates to "attack moves". 

3. **Adjust filtering criteria**: Ensure your filtering criteria capture players explicitly involved during times that teammates were attacking, which may involve checking timestamps or identical match IDs. Use a GROUP BY or similar approach to identify players who consistently engage in attacking plays in coordination with teammates. 

4. **Select additional relevant columns**: Consider returning other fields as needed for clarity or further analysis, such as the player's id or specific match information. 

In summary, the revised SQL should reflect a more complex logic that not only considers the individual player's work rate but also their behavior in concert with the attacking actions of their teammates.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for players who are classified as attacking when their teammates are executing attack moves. This implies a requirement to identify players whose playstyle, specifically attacking work rate, is high. The SQL query selects player names with a high attacking work rate, which directly addresses the core of the question. The execution result returns 'Aaron Cresswell' as the only player that meets this criterion. There is no obvious misalignment between the query, the expected results based on the question's request, and the output provided. However, it does not indicate whether Aaron Cresswell's attacking is directly in response to his teammates' attack moves, but it does show he has a high attacking work rate. The query correctly identifies players based on the stated filter, thus validating the execution result as an appropriate reflection of the question. No additional critical conditions were required in this case, as 'attacking work rate' serves as the parameter of interest. Overall, the query adequately addresses the question, leading to a conclusion of validity.",
