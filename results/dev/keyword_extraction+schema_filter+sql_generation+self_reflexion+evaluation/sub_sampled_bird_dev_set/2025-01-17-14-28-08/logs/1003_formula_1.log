Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: How many accidents did the driver who had the highest number accidents in the Canadian Grand Prix have?

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To answer the question, I first need to identify the race that corresponds to the 'Canadian Grand Prix.' This can be done by querying the `races` table to find the `raceId` where the `name` is 'Canadian Grand Prix.' Next, I need to find out which driver had the highest number of accidents in that specific race. The accidents are defined by `statusId = 3` in the `results` table. I will count the number of accidents per driver in the `results` table grouped by `driverId` and filter to include only those from the Canadian Grand Prix. To identify the driver with the highest accidents, I will use the `ORDER BY` clause on the count and limit the result to the top driver. Finally, I will count how many accidents that driver had by using a subquery to get the driver's accidents. Therefore, the approach includes two main operations: identifying the raceId for the Canadian Grand Prix and then counting accidents grouped by driver from the results table where the raceId matches and the statusId indicates an accident.",

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
How many accidents did the driver who had the highest number accidents in the Canadian Grand Prix have?

SQL Query:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM results WHERE driverId = (SELECT driverId FROM results WHERE raceId = (SELECT raceId FROM races WHERE name = 'Canadian Grand Prix') AND statusId = 3 GROUP BY driverId ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1) AND statusId = 3;

Execution Result:
(4,)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the number of accidents attributed to the driver with the highest number of accidents in the Canadian Grand Prix. The SQL query aims to find this by first identifying the top driver in terms of accidents from the Canadian Grand Prix and then counting how many accidents that driver had overall. The inner nested query correctly fetches the race ID for the Canadian Grand Prix, and the driver ID for the driver with the highest count of accidents with a status of 3 (presumably indicating a finished race). The outer query then counts the number of accidents for that driver where the status is also 3. The execution result of '4' indicates that the identified driver had 4 accidents, which correctly answers the question. Since all elements are aligned and accounted for without any logical gaps or missing information, the SQL query is correctly constructed and fully answers the question.",
    "judgment": "Valid"
