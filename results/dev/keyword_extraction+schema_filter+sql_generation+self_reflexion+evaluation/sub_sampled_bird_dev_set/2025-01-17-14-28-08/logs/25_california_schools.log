This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Next, I'll compute the average of the average math scores from the 'satscores' table, grouping by the school. Finally, I will filter out the groups where the average math score is higher than 400 and select the names of the schools along with their funding types. Using aggregate functions, I will also ensure to skip null values while calculating averages to maintain data integrity.",

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Name schools in Riverside which the average of average math score for SAT is grater than 400, what is the funding type of these schools?

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.School, T1.FundingType FROM schools T1 JOIN satscores T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds WHERE T1.City = 'Riverside' GROUP BY T1.CDSCode HAVING AVG(T2.AvgScrMath) > 400;

Execution Result:
(None, None)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
Name schools in Riverside which the average of average math score for SAT is grater than 400, what is the funding type of these schools?

Predicted SQL:
SELECT T1.School, T1.FundingType FROM schools T1 JOIN satscores T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds WHERE T1.City = 'Riverside' GROUP BY T1.CDSCode HAVING AVG(T2.AvgScrMath) > 400;

Execution Result:
(None, None)

Evaluation Result:

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "1. Verify Data Availability: Before modifying the SQL query, check the underlying data in both the 'schools' and 'satscores' tables to confirm that there are, in fact, schools located in Riverside and that they have corresponding SAT scores recorded. If no schools exist in Riverside or if their scores are not recorded, the execution will naturally return no results.\n\n2. Update the GROUP BY Clause: The current query groups results by T1.CDSCode, but it doesn't ensure that the School name can be selected correctly. Modify the GROUP BY clause to include T1.School in addition to T1.CDSCode, or use T1.School alone if it\u2019s unique to the CDSCode. \n   - Change to: GROUP BY T1.School, T1.CDSCode\n\n3. Use Proper Aggregation: Ensure that both columns selected (School and FundingType) in the SELECT statement are appropriately aggregated or included in the GROUP BY clause. You may include the funding type in the SELECT statement directly, however, ensure all necessary aggregations align with SQL standards.\n\n4. Return Only Valid Schools: To align more closely with the question\u2019s intent, ensure the results filter for those schools that meet the average score criteria before selecting the retrieved schools.\n\n5. Consider Adding a WHERE Clause: If needed, introduce a WHERE clause to make certain that you are only looking at schools with valid SAT scores. For example, WHERE T2.AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL, to exclude schools that might lack scores.\n\n6. Final Query Structure: The revised SQL query could look like this:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT T1.School, T1.FundingType\n   FROM schools T1\n   JOIN satscores T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds\n   WHERE T1.City = 'Riverside'\n   AND T2.AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL\n   GROUP BY T1.School, T1.CDSCode, T1.FundingType\n   HAVING AVG(T2.AvgScrMath) > 400;\n   ```\n   This version ensures that the query is logically organized, meeting all conditions and requirements specified in the original question."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify Data Availability: Before modifying the SQL query, check the underlying data in both the 'schools' and 'satscores' tables to confirm that there are, in fact, schools located in Riverside and that they have corresponding SAT scores recorded. If no schools exist in Riverside or if their scores are not recorded, the execution will naturally return no results.

2. Update the GROUP BY Clause: The current query groups results by T1.CDSCode, but it doesn't ensure that the School name can be selected correctly. Modify the GROUP BY clause to include T1.School in addition to T1.CDSCode, or use T1.School alone if it’s unique to the CDSCode. 
   - Change to: GROUP BY T1.School, T1.CDSCode

3. Use Proper Aggregation: Ensure that both columns selected (School and FundingType) in the SELECT statement are appropriately aggregated or included in the GROUP BY clause. You may include the funding type in the SELECT statement directly, however, ensure all necessary aggregations align with SQL standards.

4. Return Only Valid Schools: To align more closely with the question’s intent, ensure the results filter for those schools that meet the average score criteria before selecting the retrieved schools.

5. Consider Adding a WHERE Clause: If needed, introduce a WHERE clause to make certain that you are only looking at schools with valid SAT scores. For example, WHERE T2.AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL, to exclude schools that might lack scores.

6. Final Query Structure: The revised SQL query could look like this:
   ```sql
   SELECT T1.School, T1.FundingType
   FROM schools T1
   JOIN satscores T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds
   WHERE T1.City = 'Riverside'
   AND T2.AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY T1.School, T1.CDSCode, T1.FundingType
   HAVING AVG(T2.AvgScrMath) > 400;
   ```
   This version ensures that the query is logically organized, meeting all conditions and requirements specified in the original question.

SELECT T1.School, T1.FundingType FROM schools T1 WHERE T1.City = 'Riverside' AND T1.CDSCode IN (SELECT T2.cds FROM satscores T2 WHERE T2.AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL GROUP BY T2.cds HAVING AVG(T2.AvgScrMath) > 400);

Execution Result:
(None, None)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify Data Availability: Before modifying the SQL query, check the underlying data in both the 'schools' and 'satscores' tables to confirm that there are, in fact, schools located in Riverside and that they have corresponding SAT scores recorded. If no schools exist in Riverside or if their scores are not recorded, the execution will naturally return no results.

2. Update the GROUP BY Clause: The current query groups results by T1.CDSCode, but it doesn't ensure that the School name can be selected correctly. Modify the GROUP BY clause to include T1.School in addition to T1.CDSCode, or use T1.School alone if it’s unique to the CDSCode. 
   - Change to: GROUP BY T1.School, T1.CDSCode

3. Use Proper Aggregation: Ensure that both columns selected (School and FundingType) in the SELECT statement are appropriately aggregated or included in the GROUP BY clause. You may include the funding type in the SELECT statement directly, however, ensure all necessary aggregations align with SQL standards.

4. Return Only Valid Schools: To align more closely with the question’s intent, ensure the results filter for those schools that meet the average score criteria before selecting the retrieved schools.

5. Consider Adding a WHERE Clause: If needed, introduce a WHERE clause to make certain that you are only looking at schools with valid SAT scores. For example, WHERE T2.AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL, to exclude schools that might lack scores.

6. Final Query Structure: The revised SQL query could look like this:
   ```sql
   SELECT T1.School, T1.FundingType
   FROM schools T1
   JOIN satscores T2 ON T1.CDSCode = T2.cds
   WHERE T1.City = 'Riverside'
   AND T2.AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL
   GROUP BY T1.School, T1.CDSCode, T1.FundingType
   HAVING AVG(T2.AvgScrMath) > 400;
   ```
   This version ensures that the query is logically organized, meeting all conditions and requirements specified in the original question.
7. To modify the SQL query and align it with the question's intent, consider the following steps: 1. Ensure Proper Aggregation: Instead of grouping by T1.School, T1.CDSCode, and T1.FundingType, first calculate the average math score in a subquery or use the AVG() function directly without grouping by T1.School to prevent incorrect results. This allows for accurate averaging over the correct set of scores. 2. Use a Subquery: Restructure the query to first create a subquery that calculates the average math score per school, and then filter based on that result. This will help isolate the schools with an average score greater than 400. 3. Adjust SQL Query: Rewrite the query as follows: 

   ```sql
   SELECT T1.School, T1.FundingType 
   FROM schools T1 
   WHERE T1.City = 'Riverside' AND T1.CDSCode IN ( 
     SELECT T2.cds 
     FROM satscores T2 
     WHERE T2.AvgScrMath IS NOT NULL 
     GROUP BY T2.cds 
     HAVING AVG(T2.AvgScrMath) > 400 
   );
   ``` 

This subquery calculates the average scores per school and filters those that meet the condition, and then you select the funding types for those schools in Riverside. 4. Validate Data: Consider validating that there are indeed schools in Riverside with non-null scores before running the modified query to anticipate potential empty results again.
8. 1. Confirm that the 'satscores' table contains records for Riverside schools and check that the CDSCode corresponds to the correct identifiers for schools in the 'schools' table. Make sure that the subquery is correctly referencing the same identifier used in both tables to establish a valid relationship.
2. Update the subquery to correctly calculate the average SAT math scores for each school instead of using the CDSCode directly. The adjusted subquery should join the 'satscores' table with the 'schools' table based on the CDSCode and then calculate the average math score per school.
3. Modify the outer query to include the selection of the average math score along with the filtering conditions to ensure the schools selected are those with an average score greater than 400.
4. Consider using a JOIN statement instead of a subquery for clarity and potentially better performance.
5. Ensure to handle NULL values correctly, especially if any schools are present but do not have SAT scores, to exclude them from the results appropriately.
