Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
Which is the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level? Please list his or her date of birth.

SQL Query:
SELECT MAX(P.Birthday) FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-')

Execution Result:
('1989-08-28',)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Instead of using MAX(P.Birthday), use a subquery or a CTE to first filter out the patients with abnormal RNP levels. 2. Select the patient(s) who have been identified as having an abnormal RNP level and include their birthday. 3. In the main query, retrieve the patient with the maximum date of birth (i.e., the youngest) from the filtered results. The revised SQL could look like this: 

WITH AbnormalPatients AS (
    SELECT P.Birthday
    FROM Patient P
    JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID
    WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-')
)
SELECT Birthday FROM AbnormalPatients ORDER BY Birthday DESC LIMIT 1;  
This will ensure that you only select the youngest patient from the subset of patients with abnormal RNP levels.

Short-Term Memory:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Instead of using MAX(P.Birthday), use a subquery or a CTE to first filter out the patients with abnormal RNP levels. 2. Select the patient(s) who have been identified as having an abnormal RNP level and include their birthday. 3. In the main query, retrieve the patient with the maximum date of birth (i.e., the youngest) from the filtered results. The revised SQL could look like this: 

WITH AbnormalPatients AS (
    SELECT P.Birthday
    FROM Patient P
    JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID
    WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-')
)
SELECT Birthday FROM AbnormalPatients ORDER BY Birthday DESC LIMIT 1;  
This will ensure that you only select the youngest patient from the subset of patients with abnormal RNP levels.
7. To modify the SQL query to correctly fulfill the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure that you are not just selecting the date of birth, but also retrieving the identifier of the patient associated with that date. In the current query, you are filtering patients correctly based on the abnormal RNP level but only selecting the Birthday. 2. Modify the subquery to not only select the `Birthday` but also the `ID` so that you can correlate it with the youngest patient. 3. Change the ordering logic to focus on finding the maximum age (i.e., the minimum Birthday) of patients with abnormal RNP levels. Use `MIN(Birthday)` instead of `ORDER BY Birthday DESC LIMIT 1` to get the youngest patient. 4. Ensure your final output includes both the ID and Birthday, and you can join back to get the patient's information if needed, but since you only need the Birthday for the output, adjust your SELECT statement accordingly. The revised SQL could look something like this: 'WITH AbnormalPatients AS (SELECT P.ID, P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-')) SELECT ID, Birthday FROM AbnormalPatients ORDER BY Birthday ASC LIMIT 1;' This will ensure you correctly identify and output the youngest patient's date of birth as requested.

Question: 
Which is the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level? Please list his or her date of birth. 

Hint:
youngest patient refers to MAX(Birthday); abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level refers to RNP NOT IN('-', '+-'); date of birth refers to Birthday;

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Instead of using MAX(P.Birthday), use a subquery or a CTE to first filter out the patients with abnormal RNP levels. 2. Select the patient(s) who have been identified as having an abnormal RNP level and include their birthday. 3. In the main query, retrieve the patient with the maximum date of birth (i.e., the youngest) from the filtered results. The revised SQL could look like this: 

WITH AbnormalPatients AS (
    SELECT P.Birthday
    FROM Patient P
    JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID
    WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-')
)
SELECT Birthday FROM AbnormalPatients ORDER BY Birthday DESC LIMIT 1;  
This will ensure that you only select the youngest patient from the subset of patients with abnormal RNP levels.
7. To modify the SQL query to correctly fulfill the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Ensure that you are not just selecting the date of birth, but also retrieving the identifier of the patient associated with that date. In the current query, you are filtering patients correctly based on the abnormal RNP level but only selecting the Birthday. 2. Modify the subquery to not only select the `Birthday` but also the `ID` so that you can correlate it with the youngest patient. 3. Change the ordering logic to focus on finding the maximum age (i.e., the minimum Birthday) of patients with abnormal RNP levels. Use `MIN(Birthday)` instead of `ORDER BY Birthday DESC LIMIT 1` to get the youngest patient. 4. Ensure your final output includes both the ID and Birthday, and you can join back to get the patient's information if needed, but since you only need the Birthday for the output, adjust your SELECT statement accordingly. The revised SQL could look something like this: 'WITH AbnormalPatients AS (SELECT P.ID, P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-')) SELECT ID, Birthday FROM AbnormalPatients ORDER BY Birthday ASC LIMIT 1;' This will ensure you correctly identify and output the youngest patient's date of birth as requested.
8. To align the SQL query with the intent of the question, the following modifications are necessary: 1. Change the ordering of the results to obtaining the youngest patient. Currently, the query uses 'ORDER BY Birthday ASC', which sorts patients from oldest to youngest. Instead, use 'ORDER BY Birthday DESC' to retrieve the youngest patient correctly. 2. Ensure that the 'LIMIT 1' clause is applied after the 'ORDER BY' to limit results to only the youngest patient, which is already correctly formatted. So the resulting query should be: 'WITH AbnormalPatients AS (SELECT P.ID, P.Birthday FROM Patient P JOIN Laboratory L ON P.ID = L.ID WHERE L.RNP NOT IN ('-', '+-')) SELECT ID, Birthday FROM AbnormalPatients ORDER BY Birthday DESC LIMIT 1;'. This modification will ensure that the query returns the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level as requested.

Question: 
Which is the youngest patient with an abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level? Please list his or her date of birth. 

Hint:
youngest patient refers to MAX(Birthday); abnormal anti-ribonuclear protein level refers to RNP NOT IN('-', '+-'); date of birth refers to Birthday;

I need to extract the ID and Birthday of these patients. Using a Common Table Expression (CTE) will allow me to filter these patients efficiently first. Then, from this filtered group of patients, I will sort the results by the Birthday in descending order to find the youngest patient and limit the output to just one record.
