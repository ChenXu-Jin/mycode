This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats?

SQL Query:
SELECT MIN(T1.originalReleaseDate), T2.format FROM cards AS T1 JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.rarity = 'mythic' AND T2.status = 'legal'

Execution Result:
(None, None)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

############################## AI at step evaluator_generate_result ##############################

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the date of the oldest mythic card's release and its legal play formats. The SQL query attempts to achieve this by selecting the minimum release date for cards with 'mythic' rarity and joining with legalities to get the relevant formats where the status is 'legal'. However, the execution result returned (None, None) indicating that no records matched the query. This suggests that there are no mythic cards with a legal status in the database. Since the query produced no results, it does not fully answer the question asked, which requires both a release date and formats to be returned. As a result, the SQL query is not correct or complete, as it fails to return any meaningful information.",
    "judgment": "Invalid"
}

############################## Human at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats?

Predicted SQL:
SELECT MIN(T1.originalReleaseDate), T2.format FROM cards AS T1 JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid WHERE T1.rarity = 'mythic' AND T2.status = 'legal'

Execution Result:
(None, None)

Evaluation Result:

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "1. **Check Data Availability**: First, investigate if there are mythic cards in the database. Run a simple query such as `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic';` to confirm the presence of any mythic cards.\n\n2. **Refine Query Conditions**: If there are mythic cards, validate that these cards should have entries in the legalities table. Ensure that the conditions in the WHERE clause are not filtering out valid data by relaxing the 'legal' status requirement or checking for other statuses that might apply.\n\n3. **Use an Aggregation with GROUP BY**: Modify the query to find the oldest release date for mythic cards and then group by legal play formats. Use a query like:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT MIN(T1.originalReleaseDate), T2.format \n   FROM cards AS T1 \n   JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid \n   WHERE T1.rarity = 'mythic' \n   GROUP BY T2.format;\n   ```\n   This ensures you are aggregating results for each format and can check which formats are available alongside the release date.\n\n4. **Consider Subqueries**: If there are still issues, consider using a subquery that first retrieves the oldest mythic card and then joins with the legalities table. Example:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT oldest.min_date, T2.format \n   FROM (SELECT MIN(originalReleaseDate) as min_date FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic') AS oldest \n   JOIN cards AS T1 ON T1.originalReleaseDate = oldest.min_date \n   JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid;\n   ```\n   This ensures that you are explicitly dealing with the oldest mythic card and its legal formats.\n\n5. **Validate Format Status**: Lastly, ensure the final output checks all potential legal statuses (if applicable) to accommodate different game formats that may not be strictly 'legal'. This approach improves the robustness of the query and aligns it with the question's intent."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. **Check Data Availability**: First, investigate if there are mythic cards in the database. Run a simple query such as `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic';` to confirm the presence of any mythic cards.

2. **Refine Query Conditions**: If there are mythic cards, validate that these cards should have entries in the legalities table. Ensure that the conditions in the WHERE clause are not filtering out valid data by relaxing the 'legal' status requirement or checking for other statuses that might apply.

3. **Use an Aggregation with GROUP BY**: Modify the query to find the oldest release date for mythic cards and then group by legal play formats. Use a query like:
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(T1.originalReleaseDate), T2.format 
   FROM cards AS T1 
   JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid 
   WHERE T1.rarity = 'mythic' 
   GROUP BY T2.format;
   ```
   This ensures you are aggregating results for each format and can check which formats are available alongside the release date.

4. **Consider Subqueries**: If there are still issues, consider using a subquery that first retrieves the oldest mythic card and then joins with the legalities table. Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT oldest.min_date, T2.format 
   FROM (SELECT MIN(originalReleaseDate) as min_date FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic') AS oldest 
   JOIN cards AS T1 ON T1.originalReleaseDate = oldest.min_date 
   JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid;
   ```
   This ensures that you are explicitly dealing with the oldest mythic card and its legal formats.

5. **Validate Format Status**: Lastly, ensure the final output checks all potential legal statuses (if applicable) to accommodate different game formats that may not be strictly 'legal'. This approach improves the robustness of the query and aligns it with the question's intent.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats?

SQL Query:
WITH OldestMythic AS (SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' AND originalReleaseDate = (SELECT MIN(originalReleaseDate) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic')) SELECT cards.originalReleaseDate, legalities.format FROM cards JOIN legalities ON cards.uuid = legalities.uuid WHERE cards.uuid IN (SELECT uuid FROM OldestMythic) AND legalities.status = 'legal';

Execution Result:
None

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. **Check Data Availability**: First, investigate if there are mythic cards in the database. Run a simple query such as `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic';` to confirm the presence of any mythic cards.

2. **Refine Query Conditions**: If there are mythic cards, validate that these cards should have entries in the legalities table. Ensure that the conditions in the WHERE clause are not filtering out valid data by relaxing the 'legal' status requirement or checking for other statuses that might apply.

3. **Use an Aggregation with GROUP BY**: Modify the query to find the oldest release date for mythic cards and then group by legal play formats. Use a query like:
   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(T1.originalReleaseDate), T2.format 
   FROM cards AS T1 
   JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid 
   WHERE T1.rarity = 'mythic' 
   GROUP BY T2.format;
   ```
   This ensures you are aggregating results for each format and can check which formats are available alongside the release date.

4. **Consider Subqueries**: If there are still issues, consider using a subquery that first retrieves the oldest mythic card and then joins with the legalities table. Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT oldest.min_date, T2.format 
   FROM (SELECT MIN(originalReleaseDate) as min_date FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic') AS oldest 
   JOIN cards AS T1 ON T1.originalReleaseDate = oldest.min_date 
   JOIN legalities AS T2 ON T1.uuid = T2.uuid;
   ```
   This ensures that you are explicitly dealing with the oldest mythic card and its legal formats.

5. **Validate Format Status**: Lastly, ensure the final output checks all potential legal statuses (if applicable) to accommodate different game formats that may not be strictly 'legal'. This approach improves the robustness of the query and aligns it with the question's intent.
7. 1. Remove the GROUP BY clause: Since the question asks for the oldest mythic card's release date along with its formats, you do not need to group the results by format. Instead, use a subquery approach to first find the oldest mythic card's release date without including GROUP BY and then retrieve the legal formats for that specific card. 

2. Use a subquery to find the oldest mythic card: Instead of trying to find both the release date and formats in a single query, you can create a subquery to find the card with the minimum release date. For example:
   `SELECT MIN(originalReleaseDate) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic'`.

3. Join with the legalities table in the outer query: Once you have the oldest release date, use it to join back to the cards table to get the uuid of that card, and then join with the legalities table to find its legal formats. Here's a rough sketch of the modified query:
   ```
   WITH OldestMythic AS (
       SELECT uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' AND originalReleaseDate = (SELECT MIN(originalReleaseDate) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic')
   )
   SELECT cards.originalReleaseDate, legalities.format 
   FROM cards 
   JOIN legalities ON cards.uuid = legalities.uuid 
   WHERE cards.uuid IN (SELECT uuid FROM OldestMythic) AND legalities.status = 'legal';
   ```
4. Ensure proper conditions: Make sure that your WHERE clauses align correctly with the intended logic, specifically focusing on rarity and legal status. 

5. Test the modified query: After making these changes, run the new SQL query to ensure it retrieves the expected data for the oldest mythic card's release date and its legal play formats.
8. 1. Check for empty results: First, verify whether there are any mythic cards in the 'cards' table. You can do this by running a simple query: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic'. If this query returns zero, then it confirms that there are no mythic cards in the database, and the original query's assumptions are incorrect.

2. Modify the CTE Logic: Instead of retrieving just the UUIDs of the oldest mythic card, you need to also select the 'originalReleaseDate' directly in the CTE. Modify the CTE to: 
   WITH OldestMythic AS (SELECT originalReleaseDate, uuid FROM cards WHERE rarity = 'mythic' ORDER BY originalReleaseDate ASC LIMIT 1) 
   This change allows you to avoid having to look for UUIDs separately.

3. Update the main SELECT statement: Adjust the main SELECT statement to retrieve the original release date directly from the CTE rather than performing another lookup on the 'cards' table. Update it to:
   SELECT OldestMythic.originalReleaseDate, legalities.format FROM OldestMythic JOIN legalities ON OldestMythic.uuid = legalities.uuid WHERE legalities.status = 'legal'.

4. Consider adding error handling: Implement conditions that ensure you handle cases where there are no valid formats available for the oldest mythic card, either by providing output stating that there are no legal formats or by returning NULL where appropriate.

5. Test the modified query: After implementing these changes, run the new query and confirm that it returns the expected results detailing when the oldest mythic card was released and its legal play formats.

Question: 
When was the oldest mythic card released and what are its legal play formats? 

Hint:
the oldest card refers to MIN(originalReleaseDate); mythic card refers to rarity = 'mythic'; legal play refers to status = 'legal'; play format refers to format
