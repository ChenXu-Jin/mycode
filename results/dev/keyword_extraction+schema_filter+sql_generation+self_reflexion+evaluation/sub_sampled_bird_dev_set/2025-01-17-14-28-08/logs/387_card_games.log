This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
What are the cards for set OGW? State the colour for these cards.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.colors FROM cards AS T1 INNER JOIN sets AS T2 ON T1.setCode = T2.code WHERE T2.code = 'OGW';

Execution Result:
(None,)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question explicitly asks for the colors of the cards from the set 'OGW'. The SQL query aims to achieve this by joining the 'cards' and 'sets' tables on the condition that the set code matches 'OGW'. However, the execution result yields 'None', indicating that there are no records returned for this query. This outcome suggests that there are either no cards associated with the set 'OGW' in the database or the filters applied in the SQL query do not find a match. Consequently, since the SQL query does not return any results, it fails to correctly answer the question about the colors of cards in the 'OGW' set. Therefore, while the SQL query's structure is appropriate and logically aligns with the question, the lack of results leads to the conclusion that it does not fully address the intent of the question.",
    "judgment": "Invalid"
}

############################## Human at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
What are the cards for set OGW? State the colour for these cards.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT T1.colors FROM cards AS T1 INNER JOIN sets AS T2 ON T1.setCode = T2.code WHERE T2.code = 'OGW';

Execution Result:
(None,)

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': "The question explicitly asks for the colors of the cards from the set 'OGW'.

Therefore, while the SQL query's structure is appropriate and logically aligns with the question, the lack of results leads to the conclusion that it does not fully address the intent of the question.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "1. Verify Data Existence: First, check if there are indeed any records in the 'cards' table corresponding to the set code 'OGW'. It may be necessary to run a simple query such as `SELECT * FROM sets WHERE code = 'OGW';` to confirm the existence of the set and then `SELECT * FROM cards WHERE setCode = 'OGW';` to check if there are cards linked to this set.\n\n2. Evaluate Set Codes: Ensure that the set code in the 'sets' table is correctly spelled and formatted. Sometimes, discrepancies such as leading/trailing spaces or case sensitivity issues can lead to zero results.\n\n3. Include Additional Output: The original question asks for both the colors of the cards and additional context. Therefore, consider running a modified SQL query that includes card details and perhaps the card names if needed for better clarity. For example:  \n   ```SQL  \n   SELECT T1.colors, T1.name  \n   FROM cards AS T1  \n   INNER JOIN sets AS T2  \n   ON T1.setCode = T2.code  \n   WHERE T2.code = 'OGW';  \n   ```  \n\n4. Check for Related Tables: Determine if there are additional tables that may influence the result. Is there a chance that the colors are represented in another table? If there are relationships to other attributes (e.g., card types), consider joining those as well.\n\n5. Review Permissions: Ensure the user executing the query has the proper permissions to access the data in both the 'cards' and 'sets' tables. If permission issues are present, it may explain why no data is returned despite correct queries.\n\n6. Consider Active Status: If there are status flags in the cards table (e.g., active/inactive), ensure you are filtering for the appropriate status to avoid missing cards that may not currently be active but should still be queried."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify Data Existence: First, check if there are indeed any records in the 'cards' table corresponding to the set code 'OGW'. It may be necessary to run a simple query such as `SELECT * FROM sets WHERE code = 'OGW';` to confirm the existence of the set and then `SELECT * FROM cards WHERE setCode = 'OGW';` to check if there are cards linked to this set.

2. Evaluate Set Codes: Ensure that the set code in the 'sets' table is correctly spelled and formatted. Sometimes, discrepancies such as leading/trailing spaces or case sensitivity issues can lead to zero results.

3. Include Additional Output: The original question asks for both the colors of the cards and additional context. Therefore, consider running a modified SQL query that includes card details and perhaps the card names if needed for better clarity. For example:  
   ```SQL  
   SELECT T1.colors, T1.name  
   FROM cards AS T1  
   INNER JOIN sets AS T2  
   ON T1.setCode = T2.code  
   WHERE T2.code = 'OGW';  
   ```  

4. Check for Related Tables: Determine if there are additional tables that may influence the result. Is there a chance that the colors are represented in another table? If there are relationships to other attributes (e.g., card types), consider joining those as well.

5. Review Permissions: Ensure the user executing the query has the proper permissions to access the data in both the 'cards' and 'sets' tables. If permission issues are present, it may explain why no data is returned despite correct queries.

6. Consider Active Status: If there are status flags in the cards table (e.g., active/inactive), ensure you are filtering for the appropriate status to avoid missing cards that may not currently be active but should still be queried.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Verify Data Existence: First, check if there are indeed any records in the 'cards' table corresponding to the set code 'OGW'. It may be necessary to run a simple query such as `SELECT * FROM sets WHERE code = 'OGW';` to confirm the existence of the set and then `SELECT * FROM cards WHERE setCode = 'OGW';` to check if there are cards linked to this set.

2. Evaluate Set Codes: Ensure that the set code in the 'sets' table is correctly spelled and formatted. Sometimes, discrepancies such as leading/trailing spaces or case sensitivity issues can lead to zero results.

3. Include Additional Output: The original question asks for both the colors of the cards and additional context. Therefore, consider running a modified SQL query that includes card details and perhaps the card names if needed for better clarity. For example:  
   ```SQL  
   SELECT T1.colors, T1.name  
   FROM cards AS T1  
   INNER JOIN sets AS T2  
   ON T1.setCode = T2.code  
   WHERE T2.code = 'OGW';  
   ```  

4. Check for Related Tables: Determine if there are additional tables that may influence the result. Is there a chance that the colors are represented in another table? If there are relationships to other attributes (e.g., card types), consider joining those as well.

5. Review Permissions: Ensure the user executing the query has the proper permissions to access the data in both the 'cards' and 'sets' tables. If permission issues are present, it may explain why no data is returned despite correct queries.

6. Consider Active Status: If there are status flags in the cards table (e.g., active/inactive), ensure you are filtering for the appropriate status to avoid missing cards that may not currently be active but should still be queried.
7. 1. Verify if the 'cards' and 'sets' tables have any entries for the set code 'OGW'. Ensure that the set code indeed exists in the 'sets' table, and that there are corresponding card entries linking to this set in the 'cards' table.
2. Modify the current SQL query to include additional descriptions of cards or their identifiers alongside colors. This will help in confirming whether cards are indeed associated with the set 'OGW'. For example, you can select not just colors but also card names or IDs: 
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT T1.colors, T1.cardName FROM cards AS T1 
   INNER JOIN sets AS T2 ON T1.setCode = T2.code 
   WHERE T2.code = 'OGW';
   ```
3. If there are still no results after verifying data integrity, consider checking for data entry issues or any inconsistencies in the naming conventions between the two tables. Adjust the query if necessary to match the naming conventions (for example, ensuring that the case matches: 'OGW' vs 'ogw').
8. 1. Verify Data Availability: Check if there are any records in the 'cards' table associated with the set 'OGW'. If there are no cards for this set, the original question cannot be answered. You might need to confirm if 'OGW' is the correct set code or if it should be a different code. 

2. Check for Case Sensitivity: Ensure that 'OGW' is correctly cased as per the conventions in your database. SQL may be case-sensitive depending on the database configuration, which could lead to zero results if the casing does not match. 

3. Review Join Conditions: Ensure that the join condition between 'cards' and 'sets' is correctly set up and that the 'setCode' and 'code' fields are accurately linking the respective tables. Consider running a simpler SELECT query to retrieve all sets and associated card colors without filtering, to understand the data better. 

4. Consider Alternative Outputs: If you determine that there are indeed no cards for 'OGW', a possible modification could be to return a message indicating that there are no cards in the specified set. This could be done using a conditional structure in SQL like COALESCE or a case when statement. 

5. Test Query with Other Set Codes: If possible, run similar queries for other set codes to confirm if your JOIN logic is functioning correctly over the dataset. If you find valid results for other sets, it further indicates a lack of data for 'OGW'.

Question: 
What are the cards for set OGW? State the colour for these cards. 

Hint:
set OGW refers to setCode = 'OGW';

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To address the question of which cards belong to the set with the set code 'OGW' and what their colors are, I need to form an SQL query that effectively extracts this information from the provided database schema. First, I analyze the relationships between the tables. The 'cards' table contains a column 'setCode' that indicates which set a card belongs to, while the 'sets' table defines the set with its specific 'code'. I need to join these two tables on their respective 'setCode' and 'code' values. To ensure clarity in the output, I will select the unique colors of those cards and consider including their names for better context. I will incorporate 'DISTINCT' to avoid duplicate entries in case multiple cards share the same color. The plan is to execute the following SQL query: SELECT DISTINCT T1.colors, T1.name FROM cards AS T1 INNER JOIN sets AS T2 ON T1.setCode = T2.code WHERE T2.code = 'OGW'. This precisely matches the requirements stated in the original question, adhering to the guiding principles of selecting needed columns and filtering based on the set code 'OGW'.",
