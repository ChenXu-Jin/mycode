You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, consider the following action steps: 1. **Check Molecule Existence**: Ensure that the 'TR346' molecule exists in the 'molecule' table. If it does not, investigate potential discrepancies in the molecule label. 2. **Use Correct Aggregation**: Modify the SQL query to separately count the distinct bond types for the 'TR346' molecule and retrieve the associated atom IDs. Currently, the query groups by atom ID which may limit the output. 3. **Split Queries for Clarity**: Consider creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) or using subqueries to first select the molecule and then join it with atoms and bonds. 4. **Reformulate the Query**: For clarity and correctness, try the following revised query: 
```sql
WITH TR346_Molecule AS (
    SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = 'TR346'
) 
SELECT 
    T1.atom_id, 
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T2.bond_type) FROM bond T2 JOIN TR346_Molecule T3 ON T2.molecule_id = T3.molecule_id) AS bond_count 
FROM

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, consider the following action steps: 1. **Check Molecule Existence**: Ensure that the 'TR346' molecule exists in the 'molecule' table. If it does not, investigate potential discrepancies in the molecule label. 2. **Use Correct Aggregation**: Modify the SQL query to separately count the distinct bond types for the 'TR346' molecule and retrieve the associated atom IDs. Currently, the query groups by atom ID which may limit the output. 3. **Split Queries for Clarity**: Consider creating a Common Table Expression (CTE) or using subqueries to first select the molecule and then join it with atoms and bonds. 4. **Reformulate the Query**: For clarity and correctness, try the following revised query: 
```sql
WITH TR346_Molecule AS (
    SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = 'TR346'
) 
SELECT 
    T1.atom_id, 
    (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT T2.bond_type) FROM bond T2 JOIN TR346_Molecule T3 ON T2.molecule_id = T3.molecule_id) AS bond_count 
FROM 
    atom T1 
JOIN 
    TR346_Molecule T3 ON T1.molecule_id = T3.molecule_id;
``` This new structure helps ensure that atom IDs are retrieved alongside distinct bond counts explicitly tied to the 'TR346' molecule.
7. 1. Verify the Existence of the TR346 Molecule: Before executing the main query, ensure that the TR346 molecule exists in the 'molecule' table. You can add a preliminary check or provide a message when no records are found for the TR346 label. 

2. Refine the CTE and Joins: Ensure that the Common Table Expression (CTE) retrieves the correct molecule ID and that subsequent joins accurately reflect relationships between tables. You may explicitly select the necessary fields rather than relying on implicit behavior. 

3. Use LEFT JOIN and COALESCE for Bond Count: Instead of using a subquery to count bond types for the TR346 molecule inside the main select statement, consider using a LEFT JOIN with the bond table to ensure you retrieve atom IDs even if there are no bonds. You can use COALESCE to return 0 when there are no bond types associated with TR346. 

4. Consolidate Query Logic: Try to combine the extraction of atom IDs and bond counts into a single query structure to avoid potential issues with empty results. For example: 

```sql
WITH TR346_Molecule AS (SELECT molecule_id FROM molecule WHERE label = 'TR346') 
SELECT T1.atom_id, 
       COALESCE(COUNT(DISTINCT T2.bond_type), 0) as bond_count 
FROM atom T1 
JOIN TR346_Molecule T3 ON T1.molecule_id = T3.molecule_id 
LEFT JOIN bond T2 ON T2.molecule_id = T3.molecule_id 
GROUP BY T1.atom_id; 
``` 

5. Ensure Final Output Matches Requirements: Always format the final output to match the specific needs of the question; ensure that both atom IDs and the bond count are clearly displayed for each record. 

6. Test Iteratively: After making these modifications, run the query incrementally to ensure it fulfills all functional requirements and address any other issues that may arise.
