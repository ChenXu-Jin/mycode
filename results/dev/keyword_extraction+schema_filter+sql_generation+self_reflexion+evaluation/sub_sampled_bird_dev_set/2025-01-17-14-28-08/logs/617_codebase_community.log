This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
What is the detailed content of the comment of the post which was created on 7/19/2010 7:37:33 PM?

SQL Query:
SELECT C.Text FROM posts AS P JOIN comments AS C ON P.Id = C.PostId WHERE P.CreaionDate = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0';

Execution Result:
None

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Next, I looked at the SQL query: it attempts to retrieve the comment text by joining the 'posts' and 'comments' tables using the post's creation date. However, there is a typo in the SQL: 'CreaionDate' should be 'CreationDate'. As a result, the SQL query would not execute correctly, leading to an execution result of 'None'. This means that the SQL is incorrectly structured and thus fails to obtain any data. Lastly, since the query contains a critical error that prevents it from running properly, it cannot fulfill the intent of the question, making it Invalid.",

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Correct the typo in the SQL query: 'CreaionDate' should be changed to 'CreationDate' to ensure that the execution can find the correct column and retrieve the desired data. 2. Ensure the date format in the WHERE clause matches the SQL database's expected format, typically 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'. The current date format appears to be correct, but it's worth double-checking if your database has specific requirements. 3. Consider that while filtering by 'CreationDate', you also need to ensure that the specific post is being selected correctly, and that any relevant comments related to that post are captured. 4. If a post can have multiple comments, ensure any additional logic is included to retrieve the correct comment in cases where multiple comments exist for a single post. You might want to add an ORDER BY clause if there are time stamps on comments to fetch the latest comment or add a LIMIT clause if you’re looking for a single comment.

[{'chain_of_thought': "To answer the question about the detailed content of the comment for a specific post creation date, I need to retrieve the 'Text' column from the 'comments' table associated with the 'CreationDate' provided. The first step is to find the 'PostId' corresponding to the specific creation date of '7/19/2010 7:37:33 PM' by checking the 'posts' table. Once I have the 'PostId', I can then query the 'comments' table to get the 'Text' of that comment filtered by the matching 'PostId'. Therefore, the final query should join both tables and ensure that the comment's text is selected for the specific post creation date.", 'SQL': "SELECT C.Text FROM posts AS P JOIN comments AS C ON P.Id = C.PostId WHERE P.CreaionDate = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0';"}, "SELECT C.Text FROM posts AS P JOIN comments AS C ON P.Id = C.PostId WHERE P.CreaionDate = '2010-07-19 19:37:33.0';"]

Question: 
What is the detailed content of the comment of the post which was created on 7/19/2010 7:37:33 PM? 

Hint:
detailed content of the comment refers to Text; created on 7/19/2010 7:37:33 PM CreationDate = 2010-07-19 19:37:33.0'

Once I have the 'PostId', I will then retrieve the 'Text' of the comment from the 'comments' table that corresponds to that 'PostId'. Since multiple comments can exist for a single post, the document implies that I need to select all associated comments. Therefore, I will run a SQL query that joins the 'posts' and 'comments' tables on the 'PostId' and filters by the specified creation date. Also, I will correct the column name 'CreaionDate' to 'CreationDate' to ensure proper execution of the query. The final SQL statement will include the selection of the comment text after confirming the right post by its creation date.",
