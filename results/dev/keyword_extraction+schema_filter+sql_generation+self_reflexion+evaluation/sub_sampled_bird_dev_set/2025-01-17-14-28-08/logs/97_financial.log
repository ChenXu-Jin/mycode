This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to incorporate conditions that specifically address the 'statement of issuance' and filter clients associated with it after a transaction categorized as 'Disponent'. Here are the actionable steps to modify the SQL query: 1. Identify the specific condition or table that relates to 'statement of issuance' and ensure it is included in the query. You may need to join another table that contains issuance details. 2. Ensure that the filter for 'Disponent' is properly applied. This might involve adding a condition to the WHERE clause that checks the role of the client in the transaction (disponent). 3. Once you have the necessary joins and conditions, update the query to reflect these requirements. The modified query could look like this: SELECT DISTINCT C.client_id FROM trans T1 JOIN account A ON T1.account_id = A.account_id JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id WHERE T1.type = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' AND D.role = 'Disponent' AND A.issuance_type = 'statement of issuance'; 4.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to incorporate conditions that specifically address the 'statement of issuance' and filter clients associated with it after a transaction categorized as 'Disponent'. Here are the actionable steps to modify the SQL query: 1. Identify the specific condition or table that relates to 'statement of issuance' and ensure it is included in the query. You may need to join another table that contains issuance details. 2. Ensure that the filter for 'Disponent' is properly applied. This might involve adding a condition to the WHERE clause that checks the role of the client in the transaction (disponent). 3. Once you have the necessary joins and conditions, update the query to reflect these requirements. The modified query could look like this: SELECT DISTINCT C.client_id FROM trans T1 JOIN account A ON T1.account_id = A.account_id JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id WHERE T1.type = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' AND D.role = 'Disponent' AND A.issuance_type = 'statement of issuance'; 4. Test the revised query to ensure it returns the expected client IDs who chose 'statement of issuance' after the relevant transactions.
7. 1. Review the filtering criteria in the WHERE clause. Ensure the criteria align with the intent of 'clients who choose statement of issuance after transaction are Disponent'. Consider if the transaction type 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' is indeed relevant to the presence of clients choosing a statement of issuance. It may be beneficial to include an additional condition that directly checks for statements of issuance rather than relying solely on transaction types.

2. Check the relationship between the 'trans', 'account', 'disp', and 'client' tables. Make sure that your joins are correctly pulling relevant records and that there are no missing entries in these tables that meet the criteria. Ensure that there are indeed clients linked to the 'Disponent' type in the 'disp' table who also have performed relevant transactions.

3. Revise the SQL query to potentially include a broader selection of transaction types if 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' is too restrictive, or explicitly adjust the criteria to check for the issuance of statements through an identifiable flag or type in the dataset. 

4. Include any necessary GROUP BY or additional SELECT elements that might provide useful context to validate the results. For example, if there are other types of account activities after the transaction that qualify, include those to see if clients can still match your criteria.

5. Finally, if the modifications still result in no clients being returned, consider analyzing the data to see if the expected 'Disponent' type records exist at all and ensure test data completeness.

Question: 
List out the clients who choose statement of issuance after transaction are Disponent? 

Hint:
'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' stands for issuance after transaction

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to incorporate conditions that specifically address the 'statement of issuance' and filter clients associated with it after a transaction categorized as 'Disponent'. Here are the actionable steps to modify the SQL query: 1. Identify the specific condition or table that relates to 'statement of issuance' and ensure it is included in the query. You may need to join another table that contains issuance details. 2. Ensure that the filter for 'Disponent' is properly applied. This might involve adding a condition to the WHERE clause that checks the role of the client in the transaction (disponent). 3. Once you have the necessary joins and conditions, update the query to reflect these requirements. The modified query could look like this: SELECT DISTINCT C.client_id FROM trans T1 JOIN account A ON T1.account_id = A.account_id JOIN disp D ON A.account_id = D.account_id JOIN client C ON D.client_id = C.client_id WHERE T1.type = 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' AND D.role = 'Disponent' AND A.issuance_type = 'statement of issuance'; 4. Test the revised query to ensure it returns the expected client IDs who chose 'statement of issuance' after the relevant transactions.
7. 1. Review the filtering criteria in the WHERE clause. Ensure the criteria align with the intent of 'clients who choose statement of issuance after transaction are Disponent'. Consider if the transaction type 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' is indeed relevant to the presence of clients choosing a statement of issuance. It may be beneficial to include an additional condition that directly checks for statements of issuance rather than relying solely on transaction types.

2. Check the relationship between the 'trans', 'account', 'disp', and 'client' tables. Make sure that your joins are correctly pulling relevant records and that there are no missing entries in these tables that meet the criteria. Ensure that there are indeed clients linked to the 'Disponent' type in the 'disp' table who also have performed relevant transactions.

3. Revise the SQL query to potentially include a broader selection of transaction types if 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' is too restrictive, or explicitly adjust the criteria to check for the issuance of statements through an identifiable flag or type in the dataset. 

4. Include any necessary GROUP BY or additional SELECT elements that might provide useful context to validate the results. For example, if there are other types of account activities after the transaction that qualify, include those to see if clients can still match your criteria.

5. Finally, if the modifications still result in no clients being returned, consider analyzing the data to see if the expected 'Disponent' type records exist at all and ensure test data completeness.
8. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, consider the following actionable steps: 1. **Check Transaction Type**: Confirm that 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' accurately represents the transaction type related to the statement of issuance. If clients may choose different transaction types in this context, you may need to revise or broaden this condition. 2. **Ensure Data Availability**: Investigate the underlying data to check if clients with a 'Disponent' type and a transaction of type 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' actually exist. There may be a lack of records in the database, or the data might not meet your condition. 3. **Consider Joining Conditions**: Review the join logic between the tables (`trans`, `account`, `disp`, and `client`). Ensure that they correctly represent the relationships you intend to query. If there's a potential alternative path to access 'Disponent' or transaction types, include it. 4. **Provide Alternative Conditions**: If the intent is broader, you might also consider gathering clients who have chosen any relevant statement of issuance (not limited to the specified transaction type) after a transaction by simply removing or adjusting the filter on `T1.type`. 5. **Aggregate Results**: Optionally, consider using an aggregate function or a GROUP BY clause if your goal is to summarize results further than just listing unique client IDs. Finally, test the modified query again to ensure expected clients appear in the result set.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To generate the correct SQL query, I need to first clarify the components of the request: 'List out the clients who choose statement of issuance after transaction are Disponent'. The phrase 'statement of issuance' refers to a selection made by clients, and 'after transaction are Disponent' implies a filtering based on transaction type and the role of the clients in the context of accounts. Since 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' signifies a transaction related to the issuance, I need to ascertain that this transaction type is accounted for in my WHERE clause. I'll be joining the tables: trans, account, disp, and client to gather the necessary client IDs. The main filter will apply to trans.type to check for the issuance-related transaction and disp.type to confirm the role of 'Disponent'. Thus, the SQL query will select distinct client IDs from these joined tables filtering by the mentioned conditions. As per the guiding principles, I will use table aliases for clarity, ensure accurate joins, and restrict the output to the client IDs required.",
