This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
List all the sets available in Italian translation. State the total number of cards per set.

SQL Query:
SELECT S.id, S.name, S.totalSetSize FROM sets AS S JOIN set_translations AS ST ON S.code = ST.setCode WHERE ST.language = 'Italian';

Execution Result:
(1, 'Tenth Edition', 508)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

The result shows a single set (Tenth Edition) along with its size. However, it does not clarify if there are more sets that may be missing from the result. The SQL query uses a join condition which means it will only return sets that have a corresponding Italian translation, which is appropriate. Still, the execution result shows only one set, which may imply that there are no other sets available in Italian.

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
List all the sets available in Italian translation. State the total number of cards per set.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT S.id, S.name, S.totalSetSize FROM sets AS S JOIN set_translations AS ST ON S.code = ST.setCode WHERE ST.language = 'Italian';

Execution Result:
(1, 'Tenth Edition', 508)

Evaluation Result:

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "To ensure that the SQL query correctly lists all sets available in Italian translation and specifies the total number of cards per set, consider the following actionable steps: \n\n1. **Confirm the Translation Availability**: The current query effectively filters sets that have a corresponding Italian translation. However, to avoid ambiguity, explicitly check for the existence of other sets by modifying the query to include an aggregation function. This way, even if a set doesn't have a translation, it won't be mistakenly assumed as unavailable. Explore using a query with a GROUP BY clause. \n\n2. **Modify the SELECT Clause**: Include a count of the total number of cards per set alongside the size of the set. This will directly address the requirement for stating the total number of cards per set in the output.  This can be done by ensuring signs of other sets are flagged as well without omitting sets without Italian translations. \n\n3. **Add DISTINCT**: Although you already join on the code, using DISTINCT in conjunction with GROUP BY will ensure unique sets are returned and will indicate the translation directly relevant to the query. \n\n4. **Full SQL Suggestion**: Consider rephrasing the query to something like: \n   ```sql\n   SELECT S.id, S.name, COUNT(DISTINCT ST.id) AS totalCards \n   FROM sets AS S \n   LEFT JOIN set_translations AS ST ON S.code = ST.setCode AND ST.language = 'Italian' \n   GROUP BY S.id, S.name;\n   ``` \nThis modification will account for all sets, provide their names, and confirm the total number of cards, irrespective of their translation, thereby clarifying the presence of additional sets in Italian. \n \n5. **Review Results**: After executing the modified query, ensure you check the results for completeness and correctness to confirm all sets in Italian are included satisfactorily."

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure that the SQL query correctly lists all sets available in Italian translation and specifies the total number of cards per set, consider the following actionable steps: 

1. **Confirm the Translation Availability**: The current query effectively filters sets that have a corresponding Italian translation. However, to avoid ambiguity, explicitly check for the existence of other sets by modifying the query to include an aggregation function. This way, even if a set doesn't have a translation, it won't be mistakenly assumed as unavailable. Explore using a query with a GROUP BY clause. 

2. **Modify the SELECT Clause**: Include a count of the total number of cards per set alongside the size of the set. This will directly address the requirement for stating the total number of cards per set in the output.  This can be done by ensuring signs of other sets are flagged as well without omitting sets without Italian translations. 

3. **Add DISTINCT**: Although you already join on the code, using DISTINCT in conjunction with GROUP BY will ensure unique sets are returned and will indicate the translation directly relevant to the query. 

4. **Full SQL Suggestion**: Consider rephrasing the query to something like: 
   ```sql
   SELECT S.id, S.name, COUNT(DISTINCT ST.id) AS totalCards 
   FROM sets AS S 
   LEFT JOIN set_translations AS ST ON S.code = ST.setCode AND ST.language = 'Italian' 
   GROUP BY S.id, S.name;
   ``` 
This modification will account for all sets, provide their names, and confirm the total number of cards, irrespective of their translation, thereby clarifying the presence of additional sets in Italian. 
 
5. **Review Results**: After executing the modified query, ensure you check the results for completeness and correctness to confirm all sets in Italian are included satisfactorily.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure that the SQL query correctly lists all sets available in Italian translation and specifies the total number of cards per set, consider the following actionable steps: 

1. **Confirm the Translation Availability**: The current query effectively filters sets that have a corresponding Italian translation. However, to avoid ambiguity, explicitly check for the existence of other sets by modifying the query to include an aggregation function. This way, even if a set doesn't have a translation, it won't be mistakenly assumed as unavailable. Explore using a query with a GROUP BY clause. 

2. **Modify the SELECT Clause**: Include a count of the total number of cards per set alongside the size of the set. This will directly address the requirement for stating the total number of cards per set in the output.  This can be done by ensuring signs of other sets are flagged as well without omitting sets without Italian translations. 

3. **Add DISTINCT**: Although you already join on the code, using DISTINCT in conjunction with GROUP BY will ensure unique sets are returned and will indicate the translation directly relevant to the query. 

4. **Full SQL Suggestion**: Consider rephrasing the query to something like: 
   ```sql
   SELECT S.id, S.name, COUNT(DISTINCT ST.id) AS totalCards 
   FROM sets AS S 
   LEFT JOIN set_translations AS ST ON S.code = ST.setCode AND ST.language = 'Italian' 
   GROUP BY S.id, S.name;
   ``` 
This modification will account for all sets, provide their names, and confirm the total number of cards, irrespective of their translation, thereby clarifying the presence of additional sets in Italian. 
 
5. **Review Results**: After executing the modified query, ensure you check the results for completeness and correctness to confirm all sets in Italian are included satisfactorily.
7. To modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent, follow these steps: 1. Change the LEFT JOIN to an INNER JOIN between the 'sets' table (S) and the 'set_translations' table (ST) so that only sets with available Italian translations are returned. 2. Include a WHERE clause to ensure that only translations in the Italian language are included in the results. 3. Ensure that the total number of cards per set (totalSetSize) is selected from the 'sets' table. The updated SQL query should look like this: SELECT S.id, S.name, S.totalSetSize FROM sets AS S INNER JOIN set_translations AS ST ON S.code = ST.setCode WHERE ST.language = 'Italian'; This will ensure that the query correctly lists all sets that have Italian translations and provides the required total number of cards per set.
8. To modify the SQL query to fully align with the question's intent, ensure that you include a condition that retrieves all sets with Italian translations, rather than just one. Change the inner join clause to ensure it properly aggregates the results, and double-check that you are accurately joining on the right fields to cover all relevant cases. Here is the revised SQL query: 'SELECT S.id, S.name, S.totalSetSize FROM sets AS S INNER JOIN set_translations AS ST ON S.code = ST.setCode WHERE ST.language = ''Italian'';' This query is already structured correctly to select all sets translated into Italian, but ensure the database contains multiple sets under that condition; if it does, the query will fetch all of them. No additional changes are needed in terms of the selection of columns, but consider verifying that the 'set_translations' table contains the translations in question, which may also require looking for distinct sets. It may also be advisable to count the total number of cards per set if the initial interpretation requires aggregating data; in that case, use 'GROUP BY S.id'.

Question: 
List all the sets available in Italian translation. State the total number of cards per set. 

Hint:
Italian translation refers to language = 'Italian'; total number of card per set refers to totalSetSize;

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
