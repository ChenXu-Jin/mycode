Objective: Analyze the given question and hint to identify and extract keywords, keyphrases, and named entities. These elements are crucial for understanding the core components of the inquiry and the guidance provided. This process involves recognizing and isolating significant terms and phrases that could be instrumental in formulating searches or queries related to the posed question.

Instructions:

Read the Question Carefully: Understand the primary focus and specific details of the question. Look for any named entities (such as organizations, locations, etc.), technical terms, and other phrases that encapsulate important aspects of the inquiry.

Analyze the Hint: The hint is designed to direct attention toward certain elements relevant to answering the question. Extract any keywords, phrases, or named entities that could provide further clarity or direction in formulating an answer.

List Keyphrases and Entities: Combine your findings from both the question and the hint into a single Python list. This list should contain:

Keywords: Single words that capture essential aspects of the question or hint.
Keyphrases: Short phrases or named entities that represent specific concepts, locations, organizations, or other significant details.
Ensure to maintain the original phrasing or terminology used in the question and hint.

Example 1:
Question: "What is the annual revenue of Acme Corp in the United States for 2022?"
Hint: "Focus on financial reports and U.S. market performance for the fiscal year 2022."

["annual revenue", "Acme Corp", "United States", "2022", "financial reports", "U.S. market performance", "fiscal year"]

Example 2:
Question: "In the Winter and Summer Olympics of 1988, which game has the most number of competitors? Find the difference of the number of competitors between the two games."
Hint: "the most number of competitors refer to MAX(COUNT(person_id)); SUBTRACT(COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Summer'), COUNT(person_id where games_name = '1988 Winter'));"

["Winter Olympics", "Summer Olympics", "1988", "1988 Summer", "Summer", "1988 Winter", "Winter", "number of competitors", "difference", "MAX(COUNT(person_id))", "games_name", "person_id"]

Example 3:
Question: "How many Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events did Ian James Thorpe compete in?"
Hint: "Men's 200 Metres Freestyle events refer to event_name = 'Swimming Men''s 200 metres Freestyle'; events compete in refers to event_id;"

["Swimming Men's 200 metres Freestyle", "Ian James Thorpe", "Ian", "James", "Thorpe", "compete in", "event_name", "event_id"]

Task:
Given the following question and hint, identify and list all relevant keywords, keyphrases, and named entities.

Question: For the patients with an abnormal anti-SM, please list the IDs of the three youngest ones.
Hint: abnormal anti-SM refers to SM NOT IN('-', '+-'); youngest refers to MAX(Birthday);

Please provide your findings as a Python list, capturing the essence of both the question and hint through the identified terms and phrases. 
Only output the Python list, no explanations needed.

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

###
Question: 
For the patients with an abnormal anti-SM, please list the IDs of the three youngest ones.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
For the patients with an abnormal anti-SM, please list the IDs of the three youngest ones.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SM NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY T1.Birthday DESC LIMIT 3;

Execution Result:
(1673252,)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Modify the SQL query to ensure it correctly identifies the three youngest patients with an abnormal anti-SM result. First, change the condition to check for abnormal results more explicitly. For example, consider using a standard like 'T2.SM IN ('abnormal_value_1', 'abnormal_value_2')' instead of filtering with NOT IN. Next, update the ORDER BY clause to 'ORDER BY T1.Birthday ASC' to sort from the youngest to oldest, as we want the youngest patients, not the oldest ones. Finally, you should check your filtering logic to ensure it captures more than one patient; consider adding additional criteria or reviewing your data to confirm there are indeed at least three patients meeting these abnormal conditions. Finally, keep the LIMIT clause set to 3 to retrieve the three IDs as required.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
[{'chain_of_thought': "To find the IDs of the three youngest patients with abnormal anti-SM levels, I will follow these steps: First, we need to filter the patients whose anti-SM value is considered abnormal, which means we will select entries from the Laboratory table where SM is not in '-', or '+-'.

Question: 
For the patients with an abnormal anti-SM, please list the IDs of the three youngest ones. 

Hint:
abnormal anti-SM refers to SM NOT IN('-', '+-'); youngest refers to MAX(Birthday);

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Modify the SQL query to ensure it correctly identifies the three youngest patients with an abnormal anti-SM result. First, change the condition to check for abnormal results more explicitly. For example, consider using a standard like 'T2.SM IN ('abnormal_value_1', 'abnormal_value_2')' instead of filtering with NOT IN. Next, update the ORDER BY clause to 'ORDER BY T1.Birthday ASC' to sort from the youngest to oldest, as we want the youngest patients, not the oldest ones. Finally, you should check your filtering logic to ensure it captures more than one patient; consider adding additional criteria or reviewing your data to confirm there are indeed at least three patients meeting these abnormal conditions. Finally, keep the LIMIT clause set to 3 to retrieve the three IDs as required.
7. 1. Correct the filtering criteria for abnormal anti-SM results: The current query checks for values that are not '-' or '+-', but it should specifically identify abnormal results. Ensure you are using the correct abnormal indicators for the anti-SM test, such as checking for values which indicate a positive abnormal result (e.g., 'positive', 'invalid', etc.). Update the WHERE clause to filter on these specific values. 

2. Adjust the ORDER BY clause: The current query correctly sorts by 'Birthday' in ascending order, which is intended to retrieve the youngest patients. However, ensure that the date format in the 'Birthday' column is properly recognized so that the sorting works as expected. 

3. Use LIMIT correctly: The USE of 'LIMIT 3' is correct, but ensure you're utilizing it only after the appropriate filtering of patients with abnormal anti-SM. Thus, ensure you're applying the limit after filtering down the dataset to just those patients. 

4. Adjust the JOIN condition if necessary: Verify that the JOIN between Patient and Laboratory tables makes sense and includes any relevant keys necessary to establish the relationship between patients and their lab results. If any additional conditions are needed to accurately specify the join, include those. 

5. Review the expected output: You should confirm that the query returns the IDs of three unique patients. If there are not enough patients with abnormal results, you might want to handle that case appropriately in your application logic, though it may not need a SQL change. 

By implementing these changes, the query should meet the question's requirements better.

Question: 
For the patients with an abnormal anti-SM, please list the IDs of the three youngest ones. 

Hint:
abnormal anti-SM refers to SM NOT IN('-', '+-'); youngest refers to MAX(Birthday);

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. Modify the SQL query to ensure it correctly identifies the three youngest patients with an abnormal anti-SM result. First, change the condition to check for abnormal results more explicitly. For example, consider using a standard like 'T2.SM IN ('abnormal_value_1', 'abnormal_value_2')' instead of filtering with NOT IN. Next, update the ORDER BY clause to 'ORDER BY T1.Birthday ASC' to sort from the youngest to oldest, as we want the youngest patients, not the oldest ones. Finally, you should check your filtering logic to ensure it captures more than one patient; consider adding additional criteria or reviewing your data to confirm there are indeed at least three patients meeting these abnormal conditions. Finally, keep the LIMIT clause set to 3 to retrieve the three IDs as required.
7. 1. Correct the filtering criteria for abnormal anti-SM results: The current query checks for values that are not '-' or '+-', but it should specifically identify abnormal results. Ensure you are using the correct abnormal indicators for the anti-SM test, such as checking for values which indicate a positive abnormal result (e.g., 'positive', 'invalid', etc.). Update the WHERE clause to filter on these specific values. 

2. Adjust the ORDER BY clause: The current query correctly sorts by 'Birthday' in ascending order, which is intended to retrieve the youngest patients. However, ensure that the date format in the 'Birthday' column is properly recognized so that the sorting works as expected. 

3. Use LIMIT correctly: The USE of 'LIMIT 3' is correct, but ensure you're utilizing it only after the appropriate filtering of patients with abnormal anti-SM. Thus, ensure you're applying the limit after filtering down the dataset to just those patients. 

4. Adjust the JOIN condition if necessary: Verify that the JOIN between Patient and Laboratory tables makes sense and includes any relevant keys necessary to establish the relationship between patients and their lab results. If any additional conditions are needed to accurately specify the join, include those. 

5. Review the expected output: You should confirm that the query returns the IDs of three unique patients. If there are not enough patients with abnormal results, you might want to handle that case appropriately in your application logic, though it may not need a SQL change. 

By implementing these changes, the query should meet the question's requirements better.
8. 1. Add a condition to ensure that you are selecting records with abnormal anti-SM results specifically, which you currently have as 'T2.SM NOT IN ('-', '+-')'. However, consider defining 'abnormal' more explicitly if there are other valid results outside of just these two. 2. The ORDER BY clause should sort the patients by their birthdays in descending order to get the youngest patients, rather than ascending. Change 'ORDER BY T1.Birthday ASC' to 'ORDER BY T1.Birthday DESC'. 3. To ensure that you're returning up to three records, you might want to check if the table has enough records with abnormal results before applying LIMIT to avoid getting a count that is not reflective of those truly satisfying the abnormal criteria. You could use a CTE (Common Table Expression) or a subquery to count how many IDs meet the criteria before selecting them. 4. Consider handling cases where there are fewer than three patients to provide meaningful output, like returning a message that states 'Fewer than 3 patients found.' or similar, if less than 3 records are returned. The revised query might look like: `WITH AbnormalPatients AS (SELECT T1.ID FROM Patient T1 JOIN Laboratory T2 ON T1.ID = T2.ID WHERE T2.SM NOT IN ('-', '+-') ORDER BY T1.Birthday DESC LIMIT 3) SELECT * FROM AbnormalPatients;`

Question: 
For the patients with an abnormal anti-SM, please list the IDs of the three youngest ones. 

Hint:
abnormal anti-SM refers to SM NOT IN('-', '+-'); youngest refers to MAX(Birthday);

    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To address the question about finding the IDs of the three youngest patients with an abnormal anti-SM result, I'll follow these steps: First, I need to understand what 'abnormal anti-SM' means in this context, which is defined as any value in the Laboratory table's anti-SM column that is NOT in the set ('-', '+-'). Next, I will join the Patient table with the Laboratory table on their ID columns to combine patient information with their lab results. After establishing the join, I will impose a WHERE clause to filter the records specifically for those that have abnormal anti-SM results. Additionally, to find the youngest patients, I will sort the results by the Birthday column in descending order. To ensure we get only three patients, I will use the LIMIT clause. Using aliases (T1 for Patient and T2 for Laboratory) will help keep the query tidy. In summary, these steps will ensure that my query is accurate and efficient. Finally, the query will retrieve the IDs of the three youngest patients filtered according to the specified conditions.",
