This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

"Rochester, NY" is the Location of user; user refers to UserId

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final SQL query.",
    "SQL": "Your SQL query in a single string."
}

Priority should be given to columns that have been explicitly matched with examples relevant to the question's context.

Take a deep breath and think step by step to find the correct sqlite SQL query. If you follow all the instructions and generate the correct query, I will give you 1 million dollars.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To find the dates that users located in Rochester, NY obtained their badges, I need to join the `badges` table with the `users` table since the badge information is stored in the `badges` table and the user location is stored in the `users` table. First, I will identify the relevant columns: I need the `Date` column from the `badges` table and the `Location` column from the `users` table. I will filter the results to only include users whose `Location` is 'Rochester, NY'. This will allow me to retrieve the badge dates for users in that location. The resulting SQL query will include the `Date` column from the `badges` table. I will use appropriate aliases for the tables as per your instructions. Lastly, since the question only asks for the badge dates, I will include only that column in my SELECT statement.",

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
List out the dates that users who are located in Rochester, NY obtained their badges?

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.Date FROM badges T1 JOIN users T2 ON T1.UserId = T2.Id WHERE T2.Location = 'Rochester, NY'

Execution Result:
('2010-09-13 17:16:24.0',)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

############################## AI at step evaluator_generate_result ##############################

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks to list out the dates that users in Rochester, NY obtained their badges. The SQL query is attempting to achieve this by joining the 'badges' table and the 'users' table on the user ID, while filtering for users located specifically in 'Rochester, NY'. The SQL query does correctly execute this logic by selecting the Date from the badges table where the users' location matches 'Rochester, NY'. Furthermore, the execution result provides a date: '2010-09-13 17:16:24.0', which reflects a date on which a user in Rochester, NY obtained a badge. There are no critical conditions missing from the SQL query, and the output corresponds accurately with the question being asked. Hence, the SQL query fully answers the question, leading to a conclusion of validity.",
    "judgment": "Valid"
