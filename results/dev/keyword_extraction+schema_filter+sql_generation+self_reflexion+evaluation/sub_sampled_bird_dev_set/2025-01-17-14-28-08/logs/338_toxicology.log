You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Update the bond_type condition: Change 'T3.bond_type = ' = '' to check for the correct representation of double bonds. Instead, use 'T3.bond_type = 'double'' or an equivalent value that correctly indicates a double bond in your database schema. Ensure you consult the schema or data dictionary to verify the accurate representation of bond types.

2. Review the JOIN conditions: Ensure that the JOIN conditions between the tables are correct and inclusive for identifying atom IDs related to bond types. You might want to check if both connections (atom_id and atom_id2) are needed or if one would suffice in your context.

3. Make sure that you filter for the correct molecule: The condition 'T3.molecule_id = 'TR012'' should remain, but review this against your database to confirm that the molecule ID exists and that it's formatted correctly.

4. Test for edge cases: Since the execution result is 'None', consider running preliminary queries to check if there are atoms of type 'C' and corresponding double bonds in the TR012 molecule. This can help verify if the lack of results is due to missing data or query logic issues.

5. Use more descriptive aliases: Improve readability by using more descriptive table aliases (e.g., atom AS a, connected AS c, bond AS b) to indicate the purpose of each join more clearly.

6. Finally, validate the expected output: Ensure the final SELECT statement accurately reflects the desired output by specifically querying 'T1.atom_id'.

Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. Update the bond_type condition: Change 'T3.bond_type = ' = '' to check for the correct representation of double bonds. Instead, use 'T3.bond_type = 'double'' or an equivalent value that correctly indicates a double bond in your database schema. Ensure you consult the schema or data dictionary to verify the accurate representation of bond types.

2. Review the JOIN conditions: Ensure that the JOIN conditions between the tables are correct and inclusive for identifying atom IDs related to bond types. You might want to check if both connections (atom_id and atom_id2) are needed or if one would suffice in your context.

3. Make sure that you filter for the correct molecule: The condition 'T3.molecule_id = 'TR012'' should remain, but review this against your database to confirm that the molecule ID exists and that it's formatted correctly.

4. Test for edge cases: Since the execution result is 'None', consider running preliminary queries to check if there are atoms of type 'C' and corresponding double bonds in the TR012 molecule. This can help verify if the lack of results is due to missing data or query logic issues.

5. Use more descriptive aliases: Improve readability by using more descriptive table aliases (e.g., atom AS a, connected AS c, bond AS b) to indicate the purpose of each join more clearly.

6. Finally, validate the expected output: Ensure the final SELECT statement accurately reflects the desired output by specifically querying 'T1.atom_id'. If multiple results are expected, consider aggregating or ensuring the output comprehensively captures all double bonded carbons in the specified molecule.
7. ["1. Correct the bonding condition in the WHERE clause: The current condition T3.bond_type = ' = ' seems to be incorrect. Double bonds are typically represented as 'double' or '2' in standard databases. Change this to the correct representation for double bonds in your database schema (e.g., T3.bond_type = 'double' or T3.bond_type = '2').", "2. Verify molecule ID filtering: Ensure that the molecule ID 'TR012' exists in the bond table and is correctly referenced in your query. If there is a discrepancy in naming or formatting, adjust accordingly.", "3. Adjust JOIN conditions for clarity: Instead of using 'OR' in the JOIN clause for connected atoms, double-check the logic to ensure that you are correctly identifying all atoms linked by connections. If a carbon atom can be connected in two distinct ways, consider joining the connected table accordingly without ambiguity.", '4. Include a distinct clause: If there is a chance of duplicate atom IDs being returned due to multiple connections, you might want to add a DISTINCT clause to eliminate duplicates from the final result, if applicable.', '5. Test and validate: After modifications, run a few sample queries to ensure that the logic correctly identifies double bonded carbons in the specified molecule and returns the expected atom ID correctly.']

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for the atom ID of a double bonded carbon in the TR012 molecule. The SQL query aims to find atoms by joining relevant tables (`atom`, `connected`, and `bond`) and applying filters for the atom's element (should be carbon, 'c'), the type of bond (double bond, indicated by '='), and ensuring it is part of the TR012 molecule. The execution result ('TR012_2') indicates a successful return of an atom ID matching the conditions. The SQL query correctly identifies the carbon atoms connected by double bonds in the specific molecule and returns a relevant atom ID.
