This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final SQL query.",
    "SQL": "Your SQL query in a single string."
}

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "First, I need to determine which table contains the information about frame effects, which is the 'cards' table. The question specifically mentions filtering cards that have 'frameEffects' equal to 'extendedart'. Therefore, I will create a SELECT query to retrieve the 'id' of the cards that meet this condition. I also need to ensure that I count the number of such cards, but since the question requests listing their ids, I'll use 'SELECT id' to get the ids of those cards directly. To filter for 'frameEffects' being 'extendedart', I'll use a WHERE clause. Finally, since we are only selecting one column which is id, I will omit any unnecessary columns. The final SQL query should count how many cards have frame effect as extendedart, while listing their ids.",

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
How many cards have frame effect as extendedart? List out the id of those cards.

SQL Query:
SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';

Execution Result:
(13524,)

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Output Format:
Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "Your thought process on how you arrived at the final judgment.",
    "judgment": "Valid or Invalid"
}

Take a deep breath, review all elements carefully, and think step by step.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The question asks for two things: the count of cards that have 'frameEffect' as 'extendedart' and a list of their IDs. The SQL query selects the 'id' of cards from the 'cards' table where 'frameEffects' equals 'extendedart'. The execution result shows that there is one card with ID '13524' that meets this condition. However, the query does not include a count of how many such cards exist, which is specifically requested in the question. Therefore, while the query does return the ID of the card as requested, it fails to provide the number of cards which is a critical part of the question. Thus, the SQL query does not fully meet the requirements of the question.",
    "judgment": "Invalid"
}

############################## Human at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

You are a data science and SQL optimization expert.
Below, you are presented with the execution result of an SQL query, an analysis of why this query does not meet the requirements, and the natural language question it aims to answer.
Your task is to generate actionable feedback to guide the modification of the SQL query so that it aligns with the question's intent.

Input Data

Question:
How many cards have frame effect as extendedart? List out the id of those cards.

Predicted SQL:
SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';

Execution Result:
(13524,)

Evaluation Result:
{'chain_of_thought_reasoning': "The question asks for two things: the count of cards that have 'frameEffect' as 'extendedart' and a list of their IDs.

Therefore, while the query does return the ID of the card as requested, it fails to provide the number of cards which is a critical part of the question. Thus, the SQL query does not fully meet the requirements of the question.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

Instructions:
1. Understand the Issue:
Analyze the Execution Result to identify how it deviates from what the Question requires.
Use the Evaluation Result for specific insights into missing conditions, incorrect logic, or extraneous outputs in the SQL query.
2. Focus on the Intent:
Break down the Question into its key requirements (e.g., target columns, conditions, expected outputs).
Cross-check these requirements against the current SQL query's behavior as described in the Execution Result and Evaluation Result.
3. Generate Feedback:
Provide clear and actionable steps to modify the SQL query to address its shortcomings.
Focus on aligning the SQL query with the Question’s intent while adhering to the Hint instructions for best practices.

Please respond with a JSON object structured as follows:

{
    "feedback": "Specific, actionable steps to modify the SQL query to align with the question's intent."
}

Take a deep breath and review the inputs thoroughly. Generate precise, actionable feedback that clearly explains how to modify the SQL query to meet the requirements.

############################## AI at step Generate feedbacks ##############################

{
    "feedback": "To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to modify it to include both the count of cards with 'frameEffect' as 'extendedart' and the list of those card IDs. Use the following steps: 1. Use a UNION or a separate query to get both the count and the IDs; alternatively, use a subquery if needed. 2. Modify the SQL query to return the count of such cards alongside their IDs. Here is a recommended SQL modification:\n\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS card_count FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';\n\nUNION ALL\n\nSELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';\n\nThis will return both the count of cards and their respective IDs, thus fully addressing the question's requirements."

1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to modify it to include both the count of cards with 'frameEffect' as 'extendedart' and the list of those card IDs. Use the following steps: 1. Use a UNION or a separate query to get both the count and the IDs; alternatively, use a subquery if needed. 2. Modify the SQL query to return the count of such cards alongside their IDs. Here is a recommended SQL modification:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS card_count FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';

UNION ALL

SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';

This will return both the count of cards and their respective IDs, thus fully addressing the question's requirements.

Short-Term Memory:

[{'chain_of_thought': "First, I need to determine which table contains the information about frame effects, which is the 'cards' table. The question specifically mentions filtering cards that have 'frameEffects' equal to 'extendedart'. Therefore, I will create a SELECT query to retrieve the 'id' of the cards that meet this condition. I also need to ensure that I count the number of such cards, but since the question requests listing their ids, I'll use 'SELECT id' to get the ids of those cards directly. To filter for 'frameEffects' being 'extendedart', I'll use a WHERE clause. Finally, since we are only selecting one column which is id, I will omit any unnecessary columns. The final SQL query should count how many cards have frame effect as extendedart, while listing their ids.", 'SQL': "SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';"}, "SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';"]

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you need to modify it to include both the count of cards with 'frameEffect' as 'extendedart' and the list of those card IDs. Use the following steps: 1. Use a UNION or a separate query to get both the count and the IDs; alternatively, use a subquery if needed. 2. Modify the SQL query to return the count of such cards alongside their IDs. Here is a recommended SQL modification:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS card_count FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';

UNION ALL

SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';

This will return both the count of cards and their respective IDs, thus fully addressing the question's requirements.
7. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you will need to perform two separate tasks within the query: first, to count the number of cards with the frame effect 'extendedart', and second, to retrieve the IDs of those cards. Instead of using UNION ALL, which combines results into a single set, you can use a single query that selects both the count and the IDs. A better approach would be to use a CTE (Common Table Expression) or a subquery to count the cards and select the IDs separately. Here's how you can modify the query:

1. Use a CTE or subquery to filter the cards with 'extendedart' frame effects.
2. In the main query, select both the COUNT of those cards and the IDs.
3. You'll want to format the output so that it provides the count and the list of IDs in a clear format.

Revised SQL example:
WITH filtered_cards AS (SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart')
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filtered_cards) AS card_count, id FROM filtered_cards;
8. To modify the SQL query to fully align with the question's intent of counting the cards with a frame effect of 'extendedart' and listing all their IDs, follow these steps: 1. Modify the final SELECT statement to focus solely on retrieving the IDs from the filtered_cards CTE. 2. To get both the count and the list of IDs, you can use a UNION or execute two separate queries, one for counting and another for listing the IDs. For example: 
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS card_count FROM filtered_cards; 
    SELECT id FROM filtered_cards; 3. Ensure that the execution of both results can be done either in a single execution block if your SQL dialect allows it, or run them sequentially. This adjustment will ensure both the total count of matching cards and the list of their IDs are presented as required.

Short-Term Memory:
Specific reasoning steps and SQL queries generated earlier in this task.
["SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';", "SELECT COUNT(*) AS card_count FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart' UNION ALL SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';", "SELECT COUNT(*) AS card_count FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart' UNION ALL SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart';", "WITH filtered_cards AS (SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart') SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filtered_cards) AS card_count, id FROM filtered_cards;", "WITH filtered_cards AS (SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart') SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filtered_cards) AS card_count, id FROM filtered_cards;"]

Question: 
How many cards have frame effect as extendedart? List out the id of those cards. 

Hint:

frame effect as extendedart refers to frameEffects = 'extendedart'


Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "The task is to find out how many cards have a frame effect labeled 'extendedart' and to also list the IDs of these cards. From the schema, we know that the frame effects are stored in the 'frameEffects' column of the 'cards' table. Initially, we need to filter the cards based on this column with the specified value 'extendedart'. A Common Table Expression (CTE) will be used to easily isolate the filtered cards. The first step is to select only the IDs of the cards with 'frameEffects' equal to 'extendedart'. In addition, I also need to count how many such cards exist. To provide clear results, I'll create a CTE named 'filtered_cards' to hold the records that match this condition. The main SELECT statement will then retrieve both the count of the filtered cards and the listed IDs. This method prevents excessive queries and keeps the logic organized and efficient. The output will include one count and the IDs of the cards, formatted for clarity. Using the knowledge from both long-term and short-term memories, I will compose the final SQL query accordingly.",
    "SQL": "WITH filtered_cards AS (SELECT id FROM cards WHERE frameEffects = 'extendedart') SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM filtered_cards) AS card_count, id FROM filtered_cards;"
