This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To determine the percentage of the cost associated with game events correctly, you need to adjust the SQL query to ensure that the denominator correctly reflects the total cost rather than counting events. Follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total cost of game events by summing the costs from the 'expense' table. 2. Calculate the overall total cost from all events to use as the denominator. 3. Make sure to join the tables appropriately. Here’s an updated version of the SQL query: 

SELECT 
    (SUM(T2.cost) / (SELECT SUM(cost) FROM expense) * 100) AS percentage 
FROM 
    event AS T1 
JOIN 
    budget AS T3 ON T1.event_id = T3.link_to_event 
JOIN 
    expense AS T2 ON T3.budget_id = T2.link_to_budget 
WHERE 
    T1.type = 'Game'; 

This modified query calculates the percentage of the total cost for game events against the overall cost of all events, which aligns with the original question's intent.

This can occur if there are no game events present in the database, leading to a situation where the SUM and COUNT would both be zero, hence producing no result. Since the result is empty, it does not provide a valid percentage calculation, representing a critical failure in addressing the question's intent despite the query structure being logical.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To determine the percentage of the cost associated with game events correctly, you need to adjust the SQL query to ensure that the denominator correctly reflects the total cost rather than counting events. Follow these steps: 1. Calculate the total cost of game events by summing the costs from the 'expense' table. 2. Calculate the overall total cost from all events to use as the denominator. 3. Make sure to join the tables appropriately. Here’s an updated version of the SQL query: 

SELECT 
    (SUM(T2.cost) / (SELECT SUM(cost) FROM expense) * 100) AS percentage 
FROM 
    event AS T1 
JOIN 
    budget AS T3 ON T1.event_id = T3.link_to_event 
JOIN 
    expense AS T2 ON T3.budget_id = T2.link_to_budget 
WHERE 
    T1.type = 'Game'; 

This modified query calculates the percentage of the total cost for game events against the overall cost of all events, which aligns with the original question's intent.
7. 1. Change the denominator of the percentage calculation from COUNT(T1.event_id) to SUM(T2.cost). The percentage should represent the cost associated with game events against the total cost of all events, not just the count of events.

2. To do this, first calculate the total cost of all events by using a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) that sums the total costs across all events. Then, calculate the total cost for game events separately and use these sums to compute the percentage.

3. Ensure there are fallback mechanisms for cases where there might not be any game events to prevent division by zero errors. For instance, you could use a CASE statement or a NULLIF to handle potential divides by zero if there are no events.

4. Finally, ensure that the SQL query does not return an empty result by using COALESCE to give a default percentage (like 0%) when there are no game events found.

The revised query structure could look something like this:

WITH TotalCosts AS (
    SELECT SUM(T2.cost) AS total_cost
    FROM budget AS T3
    JOIN expense AS T2 ON T3.budget_id = T2.link_to_budget
),
GameCosts AS (
    SELECT SUM(T2.cost) AS game_cost
    FROM event AS T1
    JOIN budget AS T3 ON T1.event_id = T3.link_to_event
    JOIN expense AS T2 ON T3.budget_id = T2.link_to_budget
    WHERE T1.type = 'Game'
)
SELECT COALESCE((game_cost / NULLIF(total_cost, 0)) * 100, 0) AS percentage
FROM GameCosts, TotalCosts;

Question: 
What is the percentage of the cost for the game events? 

Hint:
game events refers to type = 'Game'; percentage = DIVIDE( SUM(cost), COUNT(event_id)) * 100

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.

The original methodology suggested using SUM(cost) divided by COUNT(event_id) multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage. However, based on the guiding principles, I realize that using COUNT(event_id) as the denominator might be misleading since we want to assess the cost proportions, not just the count of game events. Instead, I should summarize the total costs of game events and then use that total against the overall total costs from the `expense` table. To avoid division by zero, I will implement a NULLIF on the total costs. If there are no game events (resulting in a total cost of 0), I will return 0 for the percentage using COALESCE. This involves creating two common table expressions to compute total costs: one for game event costs and another for total event costs.

WHERE 
    T1.type = 'Game'; 

This modified query calculates the percentage of the total cost for game events against the overall cost of all events, which aligns with the original question's intent.
7. 1. Change the denominator of the percentage calculation from COUNT(T1.event_id) to SUM(T2.cost). The percentage should represent the cost associated with game events against the total cost of all events, not just the count of events.

2. To do this, first calculate the total cost of all events by using a subquery or a common table expression (CTE) that sums the total costs across all events. Then, calculate the total cost for game events separately and use these sums to compute the percentage.

FROM GameCosts, TotalCosts;
8. 1. Check for Game Costs: Before computing the percentage, ensure that the query checks if there are actual game costs to avoid calculating a percentage based on zeros. You may want to include a condition that explicitly returns a message or a specific value if no game costs are found. 

2. Use Conditional Logic: Modify the final selection to ensure it safely handles scenarios where either total_cost or game_cost is zero by leveraging a CASE statement. For instance:
   SELECT CASE WHEN total_cost > 0 THEN (game_cost / total_cost) * 100 ELSE 0 END AS percentage 
   This clearly defines what happens when no total costs exist.

3. Validate Joins: Validate the join conditions to ensure that game-related events are accurately referenced. This may involve checking if event types truly reflect the 'Game' category correctly.

4. Test with Real Data: Execute the revised SQL against a dataset containing both game and non-game events to validate that it correctly computes the expected percentages based on available data.

5. Ensure Non-Null Returns: To further enhance readability and ensure that your result is clear, make sure to use COALESCE when obtaining the final percentage. 
   Replace: COALESCE((game_cost / NULLIF(total_cost, 0)) * 100, 0) 
   With: COALESCE((CASE WHEN total_cost > 0 THEN (game_cost / total_cost) * 100 ELSE 0 END), 0) 

By implementing these changes, the SQL query will better align with the question's objectives and provide meaningful results.

Question: 
What is the percentage of the cost for the game events? 

Hint:
game events refers to type = 'Game'; percentage = DIVIDE( SUM(cost), COUNT(event_id)) * 100

{
    "chain_of_thought_reasoning": "To determine the percentage of the cost for game events, I will summarize the costs of these specific events. The requirement is to filter for events where the type is 'Game'. According to the hint, the percentage is calculated as (SUM(cost) / COUNT(event_id)) * 100. However, I need to modify this approach to reflect the actual costs rather than just counting the events, ensuring there are no division by zero errors. Thus, I will join the event table with the budget and expense tables, sum up the costs associated with game events, and also gather the total cost for all events to calculate the required percentage correctly. To ensure robustness, I will employ a Common Table Expression (CTE) to make the subquery and calculations clearer and safer from potential zero divisibility. The final query will utilize COALESCE and NULLIF to handle cases where there might be no game events, ensuring that a percentage of 0 is returned in such cases instead of null or an error.",
