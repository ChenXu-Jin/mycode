You are a data science expert.
Below, you are presented with a database schema and a question.
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query think step by step on how to write the query.

Database Schema
###
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE bond (
  `bond_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `bond_type` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`bond_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)
);

CREATE TABLE connected (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `atom_id2` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `bond_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`,`atom_id2`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`atom_id2`) REFERENCES `atom` (`atom_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (`bond_id`) REFERENCES `bond` (`bond_id`) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are a data science expert with memory-enhanced capabilities.
Below, you are presented with a database schema, a natural language question, long-term memory (guiding principles), and short-term memory (task-specific history).
Your task is to read the schema, understand the question, and generate a valid SQLite query to answer the question.
Before generating the final SQL query, think step by step on how to write the query, leveraging both long-term and short-term memory.

Input Data:

Database Scehma:
CREATE TABLE atom (
  `atom_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `molecule_id` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  `element` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`atom_id`),
  FOREIGN KEY (`molecule_id`) REFERENCES `molecule` (`molecule_id`)

);

CREATE TABLE molecule (
  `molecule_id` TEXT NOT NULL,
  `label` TEXT DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`molecule_id`)
);

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. **Check Bond Type Representation**: Ensure that the representation of a double bond in the database is correctly specified in the `bond_type` column. The current query uses ' = ', which may not be the correct representation for a double bond. Common representations include '=' or 'double'. Update `T2.bond_type = ' = '` to the correct representation, for example: `T2.bond_type = '='`. 

2. **Refine the Join Conditions**: Review the join conditions between the `molecule`, `bond`, `connected`, and `atom` tables to ensure that they correctly reflect the desired relationship. It may be necessary to explicitly verify how sulfur atoms are connected via double bonds in the data schema to ensure accurate results. 

3. **Include Bond Context**: Instead of limiting the focus solely on double bonds, consider if any specific context tied to sulfur atoms is missed. For instance, you could broaden the scope to include checks for sulfur atoms in general and aggregate any relevant types of bonds. Optionality could also be explored, e.g., `OR` conditions if dismissed due to incorrect binary restrictions. 

4. **Debugging Steps**: To better understand why no results are returned, consider running simpler queries on each individual join (like checking for sulfur atoms or double bonds independently) to isolate which segment of the query is returning no results. This could provide insights into missing data or incorrect conditions. 

5. **Consider Data Integrity**: Lastly, verify the data integrity and validity in the underlying tables to ensure they contain the expected entries for both sulfur atoms and double bonds. If the data has structural issues, the query will not yield results regardless of its accuracy.

{
    "feedback": "To modify the SQL query so that it effectively answers the question regarding which molecules consist of a sulphur atom with a double bond, consider the following actionable steps: 1. Verify the Bond Type Representation: Ensure that the representation of a double bond in the 'bond' table is correctly indicated as '='. It's possible that the database might use a different notation (like 'double') for bond types. 2. Adjust the JOIN Conditions: The SQL query currently focuses on 'atom_id2' in the JOIN with the 'connected' table. Check if 'atom_id1' might also need to be considered if a sulphur atom could be participating in a double bond and is represented with 'atom_id1'. Ensure that both connections to sulphur atoms are evaluated. 3. Review Atom Element Filtering: The filtering for sulphur atoms is correct, but ensure that the appropriate case and naming conventions are followed, e.g., 'S'. 4. Expand the Criteria: Consider expanding the criteria to include any additional details (e.g., specific molecule types or states) that might be required. An example of an updated SQL query could be: `SELECT DISTINCT T4.molecule_id FROM molecule AS T4 JOIN bond AS T2 ON T2.molecule_id = T4.molecule_id JOIN connected AS T3 ON T2.bond_id = T3.bond_id JOIN atom AS T1 ON (T3.atom_id1 = T1.atom_id OR T3.atom_id2 = T1.atom_id) WHERE T1.element = 'S' AND T2.bond_type = '=';`. 5.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. 1. **Check Bond Type Representation**: Ensure that the representation of a double bond in the database is correctly specified in the `bond_type` column. The current query uses ' = ', which may not be the correct representation for a double bond. Common representations include '=' or 'double'. Update `T2.bond_type = ' = '` to the correct representation, for example: `T2.bond_type = '='`. 

2. **Refine the Join Conditions**: Review the join conditions between the `molecule`, `bond`, `connected`, and `atom` tables to ensure that they correctly reflect the desired relationship. It may be necessary to explicitly verify how sulfur atoms are connected via double bonds in the data schema to ensure accurate results. 

3. **Include Bond Context**: Instead of limiting the focus solely on double bonds, consider if any specific context tied to sulfur atoms is missed. For instance, you could broaden the scope to include checks for sulfur atoms in general and aggregate any relevant types of bonds. Optionality could also be explored, e.g., `OR` conditions if dismissed due to incorrect binary restrictions. 

4. **Debugging Steps**: To better understand why no results are returned, consider running simpler queries on each individual join (like checking for sulfur atoms or double bonds independently) to isolate which segment of the query is returning no results. This could provide insights into missing data or incorrect conditions. 

5. **Consider Data Integrity**: Lastly, verify the data integrity and validity in the underlying tables to ensure they contain the expected entries for both sulfur atoms and double bonds. If the data has structural issues, the query will not yield results regardless of its accuracy.
7. To modify the SQL query so that it effectively answers the question regarding which molecules consist of a sulphur atom with a double bond, consider the following actionable steps: 1. Verify the Bond Type Representation: Ensure that the representation of a double bond in the 'bond' table is correctly indicated as '='. It's possible that the database might use a different notation (like 'double') for bond types. 2. Adjust the JOIN Conditions: The SQL query currently focuses on 'atom_id2' in the JOIN with the 'connected' table. Check if 'atom_id1' might also need to be considered if a sulphur atom could be participating in a double bond and is represented with 'atom_id1'. Ensure that both connections to sulphur atoms are evaluated. 3. Review Atom Element Filtering: The filtering for sulphur atoms is correct, but ensure that the appropriate case and naming conventions are followed, e.g., 'S'. 4. Expand the Criteria: Consider expanding the criteria to include any additional details (e.g., specific molecule types or states) that might be required. An example of an updated SQL query could be: `SELECT DISTINCT T4.molecule_id FROM molecule AS T4 JOIN bond AS T2 ON T2.molecule_id = T4.molecule_id JOIN connected AS T3 ON T2.bond_id = T3.bond_id JOIN atom AS T1 ON (T3.atom_id1 = T1.atom_id OR T3.atom_id2 = T1.atom_id) WHERE T1.element = 'S' AND T2.bond_type = '=';`. 5. Test the Adjusted Query: After making the suggested modifications, test the modified query to see if it yields valid results that align with the intended question. This may help identify additional adjustments needed for successful execution.
