This schema offers an in-depth description of the database's architecture, detailing tables, columns, primary keys, foreign keys, and any pertinent information regarding relationships or constraints. Special attention should be given to the examples listed beside each column, as they directly hint at which columns are relevant to our query.

Database admin instructions:
1. When you need to find the highest or lowest values based on a certain condition, using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 is prefered over using MAX/MIN within sub queries.
2. If predicted query includes an ORDER BY clause to sort the results, you should only include the column(s) used for sorting in the SELECT clause if the question specifically ask for them. Otherwise, omit these columns from the SELECT.
3. If the question doesn't specify exactly which columns to select, between name column and id column, prefer to select id column.
4. Make sure you only output the information that is asked in the question. If the question asks for a specific column, make sure to only include that column in the SELECT clause, nothing more.
5. Predicted query should return all of the information asked in the question without any missing or extra information.
6. For key phrases mentioned in the question, we have provided the most similar values within the columns denoted by "-- examples" in front of the corresponding column names. This is a crucial hint indicating the correct columns to use for your SQL query.
7. No matter of how many things the question asks, you should only return one SQL query as the answer having all the information asked in the question, seperated by a comma.
8. Never use || to concatenate columns in the SELECT. Rather output the columns as they are.
9. If you are joining multiple tables, make sure to use alias names for the tables and use the alias names to reference the columns in the query. Use T1, T2, T3, ... as alias names.
10. If you are doing a logical operation on a column, such as mathematical operations and sorting, make sure to filter null values within those columns.

You are an SQL validation expert.
Below, you are presented with a natural language question, an SQL query, and its execution result.
Your task is to determine if the provided SQL query correctly and fully answers the given question based on the result.
Before making the final judgment, think step by step to analyze the alignment between the question, SQL query, and execution result.

Input Data

Question:
List the eyes, hair and skin colour of all female superheroes published by Dark Horse Comics.

SQL Query:
SELECT T1.eye_colour_id, T1.hair_colour_id, T1.skin_colour_id FROM superhero T1 JOIN gender T2 ON T1.gender_id = T2.id JOIN publisher T3 ON T1.publisher_id = T3.id WHERE T2.gender = 'Female' AND T3.publisher_name = 'Dark Horse Comics';

Execution Result:

Validation Guidelines:

1. Carefully analyze the Question to understand its intent, including what is being queried, conditions, filters, and expected outputs.
2. Check if the SQL Query logically corresponds to the Question, covering all necessary components such as filtering conditions, aggregations, and groupings.
3. Cross-check the Execution Result with the Question to ensure the output aligns with the intent.
4. Ensure the SQL Query is not missing any critical conditions or columns required to fulfill the Question's requirements.
5. If the SQL Query satisfies the intent and the Execution Result correctly answers the Question, consider it Valid. Otherwise, consider it Invalid.
6. Consider scenarios where the SQL Query may partially meet the intent but fails in key aspects, leading to an Invalid outcome.
7. Base your judgment strictly on the correspondence between the question, SQL query, and execution result without making assumptions.

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure the SQL query aligns with the question's intent of listing the eyes, hair, and skin color of all female superheroes published by Dark Horse Comics, modify the SQL query as follows: 1. Include the 'DISTINCT' keyword in the SELECT statement to ensure that unique combinations of eye, hair, and skin colors are returned, preventing any duplicates from appearing in the results. 2. Change the SELECT statement to: 'SELECT DISTINCT T1.eye_colour_id, T1.hair_colour_id, T1.skin_colour_id' to ensure all relevant combinations are captured. 3. Ensure that the table names (superhero, gender, and publisher) are correctly used, matching any existing schema definitively. 4. Run the modified query to capture all relevant records instead of a single set of attributes, which might limit the response to only one superhero's data.

Thus, while the query fulfills the filtering criteria in the question, it does not provide the requested data in an understandable format. Therefore, the SQL query does not fully satisfy the specific request for the colors as it only retrieves identifiers. This results in a conclusion that the SQL query is incomplete in terms of providing the full dataset required by the question.", 'judgment': 'Invalid'}

Long-Term Memory:
Guiding principles and accumulated insights from prior SQL generation tasks.
1. Prefer ORDER BY + LIMIT over MAX/MIN: When finding the highest or lowest values, prioritize using ORDER BY + LIMIT 1 instead of MAX/MIN in subqueries.
2. Select columns as needed: Include sorting columns in SELECT only if explicitly requested. If no specific columns are mentioned, prefer the id column over the name column.
3. Match the question's requirements precisely: Ensure the query returns only the columns and information explicitly asked for, avoiding extra or missing content.
4. Use table aliases and filter nulls: When joining multiple tables, use T1, T2, ... as table aliases and filter null values in columns used for logical operations (e.g., sorting or calculations).
5. Avoid column concatenation: Do not use || to concatenate columns in SELECT; output the columns as they are.
6. To ensure the SQL query aligns with the question's intent of listing the eyes, hair, and skin color of all female superheroes published by Dark Horse Comics, modify the SQL query as follows: 1. Include the 'DISTINCT' keyword in the SELECT statement to ensure that unique combinations of eye, hair, and skin colors are returned, preventing any duplicates from appearing in the results. 2. Change the SELECT statement to: 'SELECT DISTINCT T1.eye_colour_id, T1.hair_colour_id, T1.skin_colour_id' to ensure all relevant combinations are captured. 3. Ensure that the table names (superhero, gender, and publisher) are correctly used, matching any existing schema definitively. 4. Run the modified query to capture all relevant records instead of a single set of attributes, which might limit the response to only one superhero's data.
7. To align the SQL query with the question's intent, you should retrieve the actual color values instead of just the IDs. This can be done by joining additional tables that contain the mappings of color IDs to their respective color names. Here are the actionable steps: 
1. Identify tables that store the mappings for eye, hair, and skin colors; for example, there may be 'eye_colour', 'hair_colour', and 'skin_colour' tables. 
2. Modify the SELECT statement to include the actual color descriptions instead of the IDs by joining these tables. Replace T1.eye_colour_id with the corresponding color field, e.g., 'eye_colour.name AS eye_colour', where 'eye_colour.name' should reference the actual name of the eye color. 
3. Ensure similar modifications for hair and skin colors. For instance, use 'hair_colour.name AS hair_colour' and 'skin_colour.name AS skin_colour'. 
4. Keep the JOINs with the 'gender' and 'publisher' tables as they are necessary for filtering based on female superheroes and Dark Horse Comics. 
5. The final query should look something like this:

SELECT DISTINCT eye_colour.name AS eye_colour, hair_colour.name AS hair_colour, skin_colour.name AS skin_colour 
FROM superhero T1 
JOIN gender T2 ON T1.gender_id = T2.id 
JOIN publisher T3 ON T1.publisher_id = T3.id 
JOIN eye_colour ON T1.eye_colour_id = eye_colour.id 
JOIN hair_colour ON T1.hair_colour_id = hair_colour.id 
JOIN skin_colour ON T1.skin_colour_id = skin_colour.id

Question: 
List the eyes, hair and skin colour of all female superheroes published by Dark Horse Comics. 

Hint:
eyes refers to eye_colour_id; hair refers to hair_colour_id; skin colour refers to skin_colour_id; female superheroes refers to gender = 'Female'; published by Dark Horse Comics refers to publisher_name = 'Dark Horse Comics';

Validation Rules
1. Carefully analyze the Question to extract its intent, including required conditions, expected outputs, and filters.
2. Use Long-term Memory to apply guiding principles and avoid common pitfalls in SQL query generation.
3. Refer to Short-term Memory to maintain consistency and reuse relevant logic where applicable.
