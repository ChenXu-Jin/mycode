I also need to focus on the 'artist' column for the illustrator's name and the 'convertedManaCost' for the highest cost. The approach requires filtering cards based on the 'side' column being NULL and then sorting the results by 'convertedManaCost' in descending order to get the highest value. Since I only need the artist's name and to ensure I'm getting the correct card, I'll limit the result to only one item. Therefore, the SQL query will select the 'artist' from the 'cards' table where 'side' is NULL, order by 'convertedManaCost' descending, and limit the output to 1.",
