The relevant tables for this inquiry are 'order' and 'disp', which are linked by the account_id. The 'disp' table relates to the client's information through the client_id. First, I'll filter 'order' for the specific order_id. Then, I will join the 'disp' table on account_id to find the client_id associated with that order. Finally, I will join the 'client' table to retrieve the client's information related to that client_id. Since we are asked who placed the order, the relevant information is primarily the client_id. Therefore, I'll return the client_id of the client who placed the order referenced by the specific order_id. The proper SQL query will incorporate all these steps by using the appropriate JOIN operations and filtering.",
