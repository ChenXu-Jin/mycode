Here are the steps I'm taking: 1. First, I will filter the `molecule` table to get the `molecule_id` for 'TR012'. 2. Next, I will join the `bond` table to find the double bonds (where `bond_type` is ' = ') associated with that molecule. 3. I'll then join the `connected` table to find the atoms connected by these double bonds. 4. Finally, I need to focus on the atoms that are carbon (element = 'c') in the `atom` table, joining everything appropriately to collect the atom IDs. By carefully navigating through the data, I can accurately pull out the specific information requested in the question.",
