The 'drivers' table contains information about the drivers including their nationality. The 'races' table contains information about the race, including the year and round. The 'results' table connects drivers to specific race results. First, I will identify the race for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix by filtering on the year 2008 and the specific circuit based on its country, which is Australia. Next, I will join the 'results' table to count how many drivers from the USA participated by filtering on the nationality column. I will select the count of distinct driver IDs to ensure I am counting unique drivers only, as multiple entries could exist for a single driver participating in the race.",
