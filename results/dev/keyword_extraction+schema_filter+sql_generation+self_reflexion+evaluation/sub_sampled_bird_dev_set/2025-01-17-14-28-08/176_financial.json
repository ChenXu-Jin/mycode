First, I will identify client 992 in the 'client' table and find their corresponding accounts via the 'disp' table. Then, I will check the 'loan' table for the debt information associated with those accounts. Finally, I will extract relevant columns: the total loan amount (debt) and the payments made. I will use appropriate JOIN statements to link the tables based on foreign key relationships and filter out any null values for clarity in the results. Since the question asks for an amount, I will select the loan amount and the amount paid (payments) without any extra columns. I will prefer using 'amount' and 'payments' from the 'loan' table as it aligns with the question focus.",
