This can be done by querying the `races` table to find the `raceId` where the `name` is 'Canadian Grand Prix.' Next, I need to find out which driver had the highest number of accidents in that specific race. The accidents are defined by `statusId = 3` in the `results` table. I will count the number of accidents per driver in the `results` table grouped by `driverId` and filter to include only those from the Canadian Grand Prix. To identify the driver with the highest accidents, I will use the `ORDER BY` clause on the count and limit the result to the top driver. Finally, I will count how many accidents that driver had by using a subquery to get the driver's accidents. Therefore, the approach includes two main operations: identifying the raceId for the Canadian Grand Prix and then counting accidents grouped by driver from the results table where the raceId matches and the statusId indicates an accident.",
