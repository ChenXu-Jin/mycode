Next, I need to check if the corresponding ALP value from the Laboratory table for that patient is within the normal range, which is defined as ALP < 300. To achieve this, I will need to join the Patient table with the Laboratory table using the ID. After filtering for the specific birthday, I will also apply the condition for the ALP value in the WHERE clause. Finally, I will select the patient's ID along with a boolean indicating if ALP is within the normal range (0 for No and 1 for Yes).",
