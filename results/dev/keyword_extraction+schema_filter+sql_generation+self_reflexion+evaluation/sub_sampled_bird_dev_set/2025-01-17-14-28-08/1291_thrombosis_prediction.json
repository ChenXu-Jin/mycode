First, we filter for male patients by checking if the SEX column equals 'M'. Then, we join the Patient table with the Laboratory table on the ID column to access the albumin and total protein levels. The conditions for normal levels of albumin and total protein are defined as ALB > 3.5 and ALB < 5.5 for albumin, and TP between 6.0 and 8.5 for total protein. We will then count the distinct IDs of patients that meet all these criteria. Finally, the result will be a count of these male patients.",
