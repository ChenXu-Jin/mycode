The key term in the question is 'statement of issuance' which corresponds to the type 'POPLATEK PO OBRATU' in the trans table under the 'type' column. We're also interested in clients who have this type of transaction. The clients are linked through the account table (account_id) to the trans table, and from the account table, we can join to the disp table to ensure that the clients are connected to disponents. The client_id from the disp table relates to the client table which contains the client information we are interested in. We will need to join the trans, account, disp, and client tables to gather the necessary information about clients who qualify under these conditions. Finally, we will select only the client_id since the question does not specify additional details to include.",
