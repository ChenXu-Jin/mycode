I first need to identify the superhero who is 185 cm tall by filtering the 'superhero' table on the 'height_cm' column. 2. I must ensure that the superhero is classified as a human by joining the 'race' table and filtering the results where 'race' equals 'human'. 3. To obtain the hair colour, I will join the 'colour' table using the 'hair_colour_id' from the 'superhero' table. 4. Since the question specifies to return the hair colour, I will select the 'colour' column from the 'colour' table. 5. I'll include necessary joins while following the given database administration instructions to ensure optimal query structure. I'll use aliases for tables for simplicity and clarity. The completed SQL query will encapsulate all these considerations.",
