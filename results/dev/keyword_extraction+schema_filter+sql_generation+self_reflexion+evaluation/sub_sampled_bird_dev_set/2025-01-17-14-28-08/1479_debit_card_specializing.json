First, I must filter the `yearmonth` table for records associated with customers who are using CZK. Since 'Currency' is a relevant column in the 'customers' table, I will use this table to find customers who are associated with CZK. Then, I will join the `customers` table with the `yearmonth` table on 'CustomerID' to get the years and their corresponding consumption values. Next, I will group the results by the year extracted from the 'Date' field (the first four characters represent the year) and sum the consumption for each year. Finally, I will order the results by consumption in descending order and limit the results to just the top result to find the year with the highest consumption.",
