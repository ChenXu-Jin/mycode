This is done by using the YEAR() function on the Birthday column to match it with 1982. Then, I need to specifically reference the ALB column from the Laboratory table, ensuring I only include patients who have a valid albumin value (i.e., not NULL) and check if this value falls within the specified range. Since excerpting the ID is a priority, I will include the Patient ID in the selection to identify each patient properly. Finally, I will use a CASE statement to return whether their albumin levels are 'Within Normal Range' or 'Out of Normal Range' based on the specified conditions.",
