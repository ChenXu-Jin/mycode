Since the player's attributes, including their volley scores, are stored in the Player_Attributes table, we will use it for both conditions: filtering by height and volley score. We will perform the following steps: 1) Select the relevant columns (in this case, the player IDs) from the Player table, filtering based on the height criterion. 2) Use a JOIN to access the volley scores from the Player_Attributes table. 3) Then apply another filter to only include those with a volley score greater than 70. Finally, we need to compute the count of such players, which can be done using the COUNT() function in the SQL query. The final query will return the count of players that meet these criteria.",
