To link superheroes with their powers, I will join the 'superhero' table and the 'hero_power' table on 'hero_id' and 'id'. Then, I will include the 'power_name' to filter for those superheroes that have the 'Adaptation' power. The resulting query will select the 'superhero_name' from the 'superhero' table. Following all instructions, I will format the SQL query to include only necessary columns and maintain proper joins and aliases.",
