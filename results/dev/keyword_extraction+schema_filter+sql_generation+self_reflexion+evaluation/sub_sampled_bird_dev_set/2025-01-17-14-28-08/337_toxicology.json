I begin by filtering the bonds associated with the molecule ID 'TR016' from the 'bond' table. Next, for each bond, I'll join with the 'connected' table to find the atoms connected by that bond, which will allow me to gather the element associated with each atom. Finally, I'll extract the relevant columns, which are 'element' from the 'atom' table and 'bond_type' from the 'bond' table. The SQL query will select these columns, ensuring there are no NULL values, filtered by the correct molecule ID.",
