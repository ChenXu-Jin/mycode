Then, to list the format of play of those cards, I need to join the 'legalities' table to retrieve the relevant format for the cards illustrated by that artist. I will first derive the artist with the least number of cards, and then filter the legalities for that artist. I will use the COUNT function to count the cards per artist, the MIN function to find the least illustrated, and a JOIN to access the associated formats.
