Identify the raceId for the 2008 Australian Grand Prix from the races table, using the conditions that year = 2008 and name = 'Australian Grand Prix'. \n2. Retrieve the finishing times for the champion and the last driver in this race from the results table, ensuring that their times are not null. \n3. Calculate the last driver's time as 'incremental time + champion time', where champion time represents the champion's finish time from the results. \n4. Finally, calculate the percentage difference in speed using the specified formula: (last driver's time - champion's time) / last driver's time * 100%.\nThe final query will join the races and results tables to get the necessary details by using appropriate filtering and calculation as specified in the question.",
