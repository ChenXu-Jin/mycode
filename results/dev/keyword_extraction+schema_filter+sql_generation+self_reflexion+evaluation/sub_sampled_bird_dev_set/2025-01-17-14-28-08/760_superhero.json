Then, we need to focus on the publishers and specifically filter out those superheroes that are published by Marvel Comics, indicated by the publisher_id of 13. The percentage calculation requires counting the total superheroes and the count of Marvel superheroes that meet the height requirement. This can be achieved by using COUNT for the total superheroes and a conditional COUNT for those published by Marvel Comics. Finally, to get the percentage, we multiply the result of the conditional COUNT by 100 and divide it by the total COUNT. All of this will form the SQL query that computes the desired percentage.",
