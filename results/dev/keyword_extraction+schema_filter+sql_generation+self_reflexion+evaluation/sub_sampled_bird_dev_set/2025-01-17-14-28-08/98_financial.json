The account and loan tables are crucial as I need to find accounts with approved loan dates in 1997 and get the approved amount. I'll join the account and loan tables because the account_id in the loan table references the account table. Next, I need to filter the loans by checking if their date is in 1997 and finding the minimum amount. To ensure only the account with the lowest approved amount is selected, I will use 'ORDER BY amount' in ascending order and limit the results to 1. Additionally, I need to filter accounts that have a frequency of 'POPLATEK TYDNE' for weekly issuance. Lastly, the query needs to select the account_id of the filtered results. Hence, the resulting SQL command will efficiently achieve that.",
