First, we must count the number of double bonds associated with 'TR006', which corresponds to bonds of type ' = '. Second, we must check if 'TR006' is carcinogenic by checking its label. We will join the molecule, bond, and connected tables to achieve this. We will filter for the specific molecule 'TR006', count the rows in the bond table that have bond_type ' = ', and select the label from the molecule table to identify its carcinogenic status. The final SQL query should group by the label to return the count of double bonds and the carcinogenic status together.",
