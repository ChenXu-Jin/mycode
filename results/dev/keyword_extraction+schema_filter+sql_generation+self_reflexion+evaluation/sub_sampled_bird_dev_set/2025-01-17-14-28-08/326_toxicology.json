Next, I need to check which of these sulfur atoms are involved in a double bond. For that, I'll filter the bond table where the bond_type is ' = '. I need to join the connected table to establish the connection between atoms and their bonds. Finally, I will join these results with the molecule table to get the corresponding molecule_id or label associated with the sulfur atom with a double bond.
