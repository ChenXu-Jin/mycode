This can be done by filtering the `frpm` table where `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1. Next, I will focus on the `Enrollment (K-12)` column to determine the school with the fewest students. To find this, I will order the results by `Enrollment (K-12)`, filtering out any null values, and select the top result using LIMIT 1. Since the administrator's email address is found in the `schools` table, I will join the `frpm` and `schools` tables using the foreign key `CDSCode`. Finally, I will select only the administrator's email address, which is stored in `AdmEmail1` from the `schools` table. The final SQL query will join both tables appropriately and apply the necessary conditions.",
