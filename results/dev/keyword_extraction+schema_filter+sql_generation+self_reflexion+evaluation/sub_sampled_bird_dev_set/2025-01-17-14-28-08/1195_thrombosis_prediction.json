I need to query the Patient table to filter for female patients by using the condition SEX = 'F'. 2. I also need to filter for patients diagnosed with SLE, which involves checking the Diagnosis column in the Patient table for 'SLE'. 3. Next, I will join the Patient table with the Laboratory table to access the ALB (albumin) column and the PLT (platelet) column. 4. I will include the condition PLT > 400 in my WHERE clause. 5. Finally, I will calculate the average blood albumin level using AVG(ALB) and ensure to perform a GROUP BY or DISTINCT as necessary, although in this case, we only need the overall average, so we don't need additional grouping. 6. I only need to include the average in the SELECT statement since the question requests that specifically. 7. I will note that we need to filter out any NULL values for ALB and PLT during the calculation. 8. The final query will be structured accordingly, selecting only the average value without any additional columns.",
