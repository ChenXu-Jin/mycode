The client table is where we can find information about clients' gender and birth dates, while the district table contains the average salary (A11). I will need to join the client and district tables based on the district_id. I'll filter for female clients (gender = 'F') and identify the oldest client by finding the minimum birth date. For the lowest average salary, I'll need to aggregate the average salary from column A11 and then select the account_id from the disp table where the client_id matches the filtered clients. Finally, I will sort this list based on the oldest birth date and lowest average salary. I will use the required columns in the SELECT statement as per the instructions provided.",
