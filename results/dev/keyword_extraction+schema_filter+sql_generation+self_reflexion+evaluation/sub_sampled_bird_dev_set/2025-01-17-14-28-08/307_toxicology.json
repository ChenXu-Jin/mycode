The relevant tables are 'atom', 'bond', and 'connected'. I will start by selecting the bond from the 'bond' table where the bond_id is 'TR000_2_3'. Then, I will find all connected atoms by checking the 'connected' table for any atoms linked to this bond. Lastly, I will retrieve the elements from the 'atom' table related to the found atom ids. Therefore, the final SQL query will involve joins between these tables to get the desired elements, ensuring I only select the 'element' column from the 'atom' table that corresponds to the specific bond.",
