Next, I need to focus on their laboratory results from the Laboratory table to find the white blood cell (WBC) levels that are considered normal (between 3.5 and 9.0). Additionally, I need to check the fibrinogen (FG) levels to find those that are classified as abnormal, which includes values less than or equal to 150 and greater than or equal to 450. The count of distinct patients who meet these criteria will be obtained by joining the Patient and Laboratory tables on the patient ID, filtering the relevant rows based on the conditions, and finally counting unique patient IDs.
