First, I need to target female superheroes, which is indicated by the gender_id corresponding to the 'Female' gender. I will join the superhero table with the gender table using the gender_id. Next, I will filter for superheroes published by 'Dark Horse Comics' by joining the superhero table with the publisher table using the publisher_id. I need to select the eye_colour_id, hair_colour_id, and skin_colour_id columns as they correspond to the eye, hair, and skin colors, respectively. These columns will need to be pulled from the superhero table. In essence, the query will join the superhero table with the gender and publisher tables using the appropriate foreign keys and apply filtering criteria to meet the specified conditions. Finally, I will specify the selection of the appropriate colour IDs.",
