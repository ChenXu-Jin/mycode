This involves counting the occurrences of each bond type associated with that molecule. I'll join the bond table with the connected table to group by bond type and count the instances. Additionally, I need to check if the molecule is carcinogenic, which can be determined by looking up the label in the molecule table. The goal is to select the bond type that has the highest count and the carcinogenic status of the molecule in a single query. I'll utilize 'GROUP BY' to group the bond types and 'ORDER BY' to order them by count, limiting the result to the maximum. Lastly, I'll join the molecule table to get the label information for the carcinogenic status.",
