Using subqueries as initially planned is safer and clearer. Let's stick to the subquery approach.Revised SQL using subqueries:```sqliteSELECT ( CAST((SELECT MAX(T2.overall_rating) FROM Player AS T1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T1.player_name = 'Ariel Borysiuk') AS REAL) - (SELECT MAX(T2.overall_rating) FROM Player AS T1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T1.player_name = 'Paulin Puel') ) * 100 / (SELECT MAX(T2.overall_rating) FROM Player AS T1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T1.player_name = 'Paulin Puel')```*(Self-correction)*: The hint uses `overall_rating WHERE player_name = '...'` which implies a single value. While `MAX` is a good way to get a single value, the example queries often use the latest value by ordering by date. Let's try that approach, assuming the latest rating is the most relevant.SQL using latest rating:```sqliteSELECT  (    CAST(      (SELECT T2.overall_rating FROM Player AS T1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T1.player_name = 'Ariel Borysiuk' ORDER BY T2.date DESC LIMIT 1)      AS REAL    )    -    (SELECT T2.overall_rating FROM Player AS T1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T1.player_name = 'Paulin Puel' ORDER BY T2.date DESC LIMIT 1)  ) * 100  /  (SELECT T2.overall_rating FROM Player AS T1 INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id WHERE T1.player_name = 'Paulin Puel' ORDER BY T2.date DESC LIMIT 1)```This query finds the latest `overall_rating` for each player by ordering their attributes by date descending and taking the top one, then calculates the percentage difference. This seems the most robust interpretation.Final Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{SELECT CAST((T1.overall_rating - T3.overall_rating) AS REAL) * 100 / T3.overall_rating FROM Player_Attributes AS T1 INNER JOIN Player AS T2 ON T1.player_api_id = T2.player_api_id INNER JOIN Player_Attributes AS T3 INNER JOIN Player AS T4 ON T3.player_api_id = T4.player_api_id WHERE T2.player_name = 'Ariel Borysiuk' AND T4.player_name = 'Paulin Puel' ORDER BY T1.date DESC, T3.date DESC LIMIT 1}}$\t----- bird -----\teuropean_football_2",
